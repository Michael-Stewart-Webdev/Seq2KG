A man named Jonathan Anozie is living this nightmare , reports TMZ , and the offending creepster is Papa John. Well , it probably isn ’ t real-life Papa John ’ s founder John Schnatter sending the texts , but an automated marketing system for his pizza chain is apparently overloading Anozie ’ s mobile notifications with offers for discounted pies. As such , the Beverly Hills , California , resident is suing the chain for $ 500 per unwanted text. The lawsuit , filed in the United States District Court Central District of California , claims Anozie replied “ STOP ” on multiple occasions , but the messages just kept coming. The alleged deluge caused the plaintiff “ to suffer a significant amount of anxiety , frustration , and annoyance. ” Who among us hasn ’ t experienced anxiety , frustration , and annoyance upon a plethora of unwanted texts ?"

His goal is to serve the “ most borderline not-sushi sushi in the world. ” He also wants to serve sushi that makes his guests wonder if they ’ re “ eating bits of plastic. ” The chef , played by Fred Armisen , was inspired to open his restaurant by a meal at the Denver airport , where he first discovered sushi with “ a fishy , sweet-for-some-reason flavor ” that crumbled in his hands. “ I want to make it like we have no love for it , ” the chef explains. Francis is the star of Portlandia ’ s hilarious Chef ’ s Table parody , which references every stylistic trademark of David Gelb ’ s hit Netflix series in under 90 seconds. This clip has everything : a candid origin story , shots of a chef walking through nature , a frenetic dinner service , and lots of intense classical music. Bravo , Portlandia :"
2,"Customers were reporting upwards of three hour-long waits at some bakeries in Hamtramck this morning as patrons from from across the region gathered to take part in the annual Paczki Day tradition of stand and wait. While in past years Fat Tuesday has fallen in the midst of an extreme cold snap or snow storm , 2017 ’ s crowds lucked out with light rain showers and relatively mild temperatures. At New Martha Washington Bakery and New Palace Bakery lines snaked through shops , out the door , and clear down full city blocks. Inside bakery staff rushed to fold boxes , fill orders , and generally get the crush of customers out the door as quickly as possible. Eater photographers Michelle and Chris Gerard stopped by metro Detroit ’ s traditional fried Polish pastry epicenter today to scope out the scene. Check out the insane morning rush photos in the gallery below."

The company apparently employed the same survey strategy before debuting its delivery venture stateside : "" These stealth tactics have been used carefully in the United States to do similar and launch successfully , and the U.K. is often used as the first international market , "" Neil Campling , a senior analyst at Aviate Global , told Reuters."

8,"Germany has long taken pride in its beer industry , boasting a 500-year-old purity law that regulates what can and ca n't go into suds produced in the country. But it appears German beer might not be as pure as it seems. Traces of glyphosate , a widely used herbicide , have been found in the country 's 14 most popular brews , Reuters reports. Glyphosate is the key ingredient in Roundup , a popular weed killer developed by American agrochemical company Monsanto. The Food and Drug Administration recently announced it would begin testing produce for the herbicide in certain types of produce because it 's been found to be a possible carcinogen. Last March , experts at the World Health Organization concluded glyphosate "" probably "" causes cancer in humans. The Munich Environmental Institute , an activist and investigative group , discovered traces of the herbicide in the country 's beer. But , industry and governmental organizations have pushed back on the findings. Germany 's Federal Institute for Risk said the amount of glyphosate found does not pose a risk : "" An adult would have to drink around 1,000 liters ( 264 U.S. gallons ) of beer a day to ingest enough quantities to be harmful for health.

10,"A burglar who broke into a Tennessee restaurant over the weekend left empty-handed , but at least they got their thirst quenched. The intruder 's target was Tomato Head restaurant in Knoxville , as WBIR reports. The suspect forced open the restaurant 's cash register only to find it empty , a rep for the Knoxville Police Department tells Eater via email ; realizing he or she was n't going to come away with any cash , the parched burglar apparently sought solace in a Dale 's Pale Ale , imbibing in a can of the popular beer from Colorado-based brewery Oskar Blues before taking off. The thief clearly was n't hungry , because nothing else was taken except for the beer , Knoxville PD says , and the cash register was the only thing disturbed. The unknown thief is n't the first to break and enter in search of sustenance : Some burger bandits in the UK broke into a soccer clubhouse and cooked themselves a meal , even leaving a note of thanks for the tasty treats ( along with nearly $ 1,500 of damage ) in their wake. In another case , a raccoon with an apparent thirst for booze broke into an alcohol storage warehouse and drank a little too much."

Called RooBox , the intention of the off-site kitchens is to "" [ bring ] restaurant brands to areas of London that have a large residential population but are currently underserved in terms of available restaurants via the Deliveroo app. "" Deliveroo specializes in delivery from "" premium "" restaurants that would n't typically offer takeout , including at least one Michelin-starred restaurant. The company only delivers food within a 2 kilometer ( 1.25 mile ) radius of each restaurant to ensure it arrives hot and fresh , but that means depending on where a customer lives , their options can be limited or even nonexistent. By providing restaurants with equipped kitchens in areas of London that are n't rife with restaurants — or at least , not the kind of restaurants Deliveroo partners with — the company can expand its customer base."

Or maybe that will happen later this year when the soft drink giant opens Kola House in the city 's Chelsea neighborhood. Kola House.

16,"Levi 's Stadium in Santa Clara , Calif. , set to host Super Bowl 50 next Sunday , is the most state-of-the-art venue in the NFL , and it has the mobile app to match. Among its many features , the official app of the big game helps fans avoid the long lines often found at concession stands , writes Mobile Sports Report. Fans can place orders on their phones , before picking up their food and beverages at express windows around the stadium. The Super Bowl app , which incorporates features from the Levi 's Stadium version , actually takes a step back.

Still , it 's a nice touch for impatient and thirsty fans who do n't want to wait for the roaming beer vendor to reach their aisle."

Earlier this week a woman in Richmond , Va. , claims she was fired by a local KFC restaurant manager about an hour after being hired once the manager found out she was transgender. Georgia Carter contacted a local TV station in Richmond after she received a phone call from the manager telling her not to come in for training the following day.
