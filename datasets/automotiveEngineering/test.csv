0,"After watching the autonomous A7 drive itself from San Fran to Las Vegas , Audi has unveiled yet another self-driving concept at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show. Dubbed the Prologue Piloted Driving Concept , the car is based off the original Prologue that debuted in LA last year but comes packing an autonomous driving system. Using a combination of video cameras , radar sensors , a laser scanner and ultrasound sensors , the information gathered is fed into a central controller known as a zFAS , enabling the model to drive itself. ( For those that care , zFAS is shorthand for ‘ zentrales Fahrerassistenzsteuergerat , ’ which translates to central driver assistance controller ) . Power comes from a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 mated to an eight-speed transmission with integrated electric motor and lithium-ion battery. The hybrid setup enables the car to generate 677 hp and 701 lb-ft of torque. 0-62 mph comes in at 3.5 seconds , while the car returns almost 30 mpg ."
1,"BMW recently shot down reports it was considering chopping the roof of the M2. Purists rejoiced. Posers were pissed. And tuner ’ s got to work. Swiss outfit Dahler Design & Technik appear to be the first to introduce a BMW M2 convertible , a project that ’ s a year in the making. Adding weight and compromising structural rigidity are the primary reasons why the M2 , a car built for track-going enthusiasts , would only ever have one body style. Dahler is well aware of these issues , which is why it gave its open-top M2 comes more power , among other things. Two states of tune are on offer , one that lifts the output of the twin-turbo inline-six from 365 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque ( with overboost ) to 402 hp and 427 lb-ft of torque , while level 2 gives the baby-M 419 hp and 450 lb-ft , and the ability to clock a sub-four second 0-62 mph time and hit a 187 mph top speed. A stainless-steel exhaust system provides a throatier soundtrack , although a silencer is also on offer to keep things respectable. A new adjustable coil-over suspension can be adjusted to suit , and also lowers the M2 , while a high performance brake system with massive 400 mm discs will keep drivers honest. Other mods include a set of CDC1 wheels staggered 20/21 inches front/rear , an MID display unit and a bespoke interior upon request ."
2,"Automotive engineers work their butts off to make the cars they design as safe and enjoyable as possible. Over the hundred plus years that humans have been building cars , we ’ ve gotten pretty good at ensuring that vehicles are easy to control and prioritize occupant safety , which means that until autonomous cars are out driving for us , human error is the main killer of cars on the road. Take this case of a smashed Alfa Romeo Giulia found by Autoblog Netherlands as an example. The reason this crash hits us right in the feels is that the Alfa Romeo in question is a Quadrifoglio model with 505 horsepower coming from 2.9 liters of twin-turbo real estate that ’ s forged in the Ferrari factory. Given that the car is so new , it ’ s one of the first crashes that ’ s taken place involving a clover-branded Alfa Romeo. To make matters worse , the 46 year old Italian man who crashed the car didn ’ t do so while trying to set a record lap time or learning the limits of the car. No , this guy ’ s only explanation is that he tossed back a few too many before setting out for a cruise in his four-door rear-wheel drive missile ."
3,"Back in 1997 , Ford launched the first Expedition , the full-size big brother to the Explorer. Both were body-on-frame chassis SUVs at the time. Today only the Expedition remains a true SUV while the Explorer has switched to a crossover. Seriously , it ’ s based on an old Volvo sedan platform. The Expedition , meanwhile , rides on the same platform as the previous generation F-150. A complete redesign is expected very soon , but we think right now is a great time to snag a 2017 Expedition because there are good deals to be found. Our tester , a fully loaded Expedition Platinum , is powered by a twin-turbo 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 with 365 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque , with power going to all four wheels through a six-speed automatic. What about a V8 option ? Forget it. The previous 5.4-liter Triton V8 has been permanently canned ."
4,"To commemorate its 50th anniversary in Japan , Ferrari has revealed a surprise new limited-edition model called the J50 during a celebration event held at the National Art Center in Tokyo. Based on the 488 Spider , the J50 is a two-seater , mid-rear-engined roadster with some striking styling that harks back to some of the most fabled Ferraris in the last 50 years. In particular , the J50 ’ s targa body is a direct throwback to Ferrari ’ s GTS range from the 1970s and 1980s , which spawned iconic models such as the Dino 246 GTS and 308 GTS. Ferrari is only building ten J50s , and every example will be bespoke to customer requirements. Powering the J50 is a 3.9-liter V8 engine lifted from the 488 , producing 681 hp through a seven-speed double-clutch transmission. The 488 Spider achieved a 0-62 mph time of 3 seconds and a top speed of 202 mph , so with an extra 20 horses we expect the J50 to be not too far off. The J50 ’ s styling is noticeably more aggressive than its more modest 488 sibling. The distinctive dividing line sloping across the doors is a nod to the iconic F40 and F50 , while the “ helmet visor ” effect seen in the windows is reminiscent of Ferrari ’ s open competition barchettas from the 1950s ."
5,"We ’ ve all been there. How many times have you been conversing with your friend , who clearly isn ’ t as infatuated with cars as you , when they incorrectly pronounce “ Porsche ” ? It ’ s one of the great debates among car fanatics. Proper gearheads will know you ’ re supposed to say Porsche with two syllables rather than one , but plenty of people will argue otherwise - particularly in America , it seems. As a car fan , hearing it mispronounced all the time makes your ears bleed. But then you ’ ll look ridiculously pedantic if you dare point out the errors of people ’ s ways. Well , it seems that Porsche is just as fed up as you are about this important issue. So , to set the record straight , it ’ s released a short and matter-of-fact , yet firmly tongue-in-cheek video lasting only 15 seconds to educate everyone on the proper way to pronounce "" Porsche "" ( its Por-Sher ) ."
6,"Autonomous technology is certainly a hot topic in the car industry right now. While it has its naysayers , there are plenty of companies envisioning a future of self-driving cars with the recent revelation that Apple is investing in the technology , while manufactures such as Ford and GM are aiming to have autonomous cars ready in the next few years. Bringing this a step closer to reality , Wired reports that the state of Michigan has become the first state to authorize autonomous cars on public roads without drivers or steering wheels. Now there 's a scary thought. A previous law in 2013 required a backup driver to be inside the autonomous car. Five states ( California , Nevada , Tennessee , Florida , and Michigan ) have now passed laws relating to autonomous driving , but there ’ s little cohesion – California , for example , still requires a backup driver. “ The fact of the matter is 75 percent of all the companies that are doing research and development in this space are in southeast Michigan , ” Transportation Director Kirk Steudle said. While automakers like Ford now have the green light to test its self-driving cars of the future on public roads in Michigan , it ’ s unclear whether the law applies to companies such as Google , which are also entering the autonomous car market ."
7,"Last week ’ s episode of “ The Grand Tour ” hit all the right marks. It featured awesome cars taking a road trip in an exotic locale. The mix of comedy and car stuff was just right. The episode felt like an old “ Top Gear , ” which is a good thing. That run of success looks primed to continue this week as Amazon has just released the trailer for the fourth episode of “ The Grand Tour. ” The trio are still in England but this time they aren ’ t leaving for Italy or some other far-off land , nor are they driving glamorous cars. Instead , the guys are building their own cars , with the goal being to create the most eco-friendly vehicle possible using truly sustainable materials. The video description also mentions that the custom cars will be taking part in a “ green motorsport event. ” The custom car challenges were some of the best episodes of the old “ Top Gear. ” It ’ s great to see the guys “ building ” their own cars once again as we ’ re almost guaranteed to see one of the three vehicles — if not all of them — fall apart in ridiculous fashion at some point during the episode. James May ’ s custom job is the early front-runner to not finish the entire episode , that is unless it actually does double as a boat like this trailer suggests. This clip doesn ’ t show much else which makes us think that the custom car challenge may be the main centerpiece , aside from a review and some in-studio bits. An entire episode centering around custom-built eco-cars sounds just fine to us ."
8,"Lamborghini has been keeping details about its new Huracan Superleggera light ( pun intended ) for the time being , shrouding its test mules in heavy camouflage and revealing nothing about the engine save for a glorious exhaust note. This time around our persistent spy photographers caught Lamborghini ’ s test drivers having another go in the Huracan “ Super Light , ” this time in the slippery white stuff , aka snow. Unfortunately , the snow only made it more difficult to pick out anything new. That 's half because the camouflage served to help the bull blend in and half because there 's hardly anything different. It ’ s been a well-documented fact that Lamborghini owners enjoy taking their high-horsepower machines on sideways excursions around their ski cabins , but this time it was the test drivers doing the leg work. Looking at the Huracan Superleggera , it ’ s tough to pick out anything new save for the center-locking bolts on the wheels , which effectively replace the five-bolt wheels we previously saw. Aside from that , the Superleggera prototype retains all of the bits and bobs we saw earlier , including its large rear wing , a spoiler in in the front , and an aggressive face that will leave competitors and onlookers alike swooning ."
9,"We ’ ve seen a spate of supercar-related accidents lately. Last week a Bugatti Chiron crashed into a ditch in Germany. Then a McLaren F1 suffered a similar fate in New Zealand. Now GTspirit reports that someone has crashed a prestigious Pagani Zonda in Tokyo , Japan. And not just any Pagani Zonda , this was a one-off special edition. Thankfully the driver survived the crash which also reportedly involved a Maybach 62S , but the same can ’ t be said for the Zonda ’ s dismembered front-end. The circumstances of the accident are unknown , but it goes without saying that a supercar can be lethal in the hands of an inexperienced driver , so it ’ s best to handle them with care. The bespoke Zonda Zozo was built by Pagani and delivered to business owner Yusaku Maezawa , founder of the online Japanese clothing company ZozoTown. It ’ s part of Pagani ’ s exclusive 760 range , which earns its name from the 760 hp generated by its naturally-aspirated 7.3-liter V12 engine. The Zozo was one of the most distinctive models in this range too , with its striking purple carbon-fiber exterior similar to Lewis Hamilton ’ s Pagani Zonda 760LH , which was also involved in an accident , ironically ."
10,"Los Angeles is the car capital of the nation. That ’ s because the city limits contain 3.8 million people while 18.6 million live within the Greater Los Angeles Area. All of them are subject to an urban design that was drawn up after the car had become a mainstay in American culture , making it incredibly hard to go anywhere without one ( although travel can be slow even with a car in LA ) . It ’ s this need for cars , and the city ’ s affinity with showing off , that prompted Alfa Romeo to show its new Stelvio off to LA. From afar , the paint job looks so good that it may as well be a billboard. Time lapse videos can be misleading , but it appears to have taken the artists a short amount of time to paint the mural given how large it is. The feat is impressive , but more telling is Alfa Romeo ’ s approach to the advertisement. In it , there are no catchy slogans , no lifestyle images , just one sexy Italian car and a winding road. This banks on two main selling points , one being the driver. The Stelvio is intended as an “ SUV for the S curves , ” and its name and the image definitely support that. On the other hand , its good looks , magnified and looming over comparatively insignificant looking BMW X and Mercedes GLE SUVs , are plastered on the wall in hopes that attention-seeking Angelenos will bite the bait ."
11,"Bugatti is about to reveal a "" new "" model , something it doesn ’ t do very often. The Vision Gran Turismo may just be a one-off that can only be “ driven ” in a video game , but it ’ s still a Bugatti. More importantly , it likely offers a few styling clues as to what we can expect to see on the upcoming Veyron successor , the Chiron , that ’ ll debut in March. Speaking of the Veyron , a design that ’ s in the past been compared to a beached whale , does it look better or worse than the Vision Gran Turismo ? The latter is certainly more aggressive and looks leaner , but it ain ’ t exactly street legal. Still though , we like where Bugatti designers are going here , but what do you think ? Does the Vision Gran Turismo take the design trophy or should it go to the Veyron ? Or are they both a pair of sand-dwelling whales ?"
12,"Spending six figures on something that ’ s not a supercar isn ’ t all that unusual these days. Aside from super sedans , such as the BMW M5 and Porsche Panamera , there ’ s also that certain high-tech and also super-fast Tesla Model S. We ourselves would honestly have a hard time deciding. And then there are also super SUVs , such as the BMW X5 M , and pretty soon the Tesla Model X. Both cool , attention-grabbing , and bonkers expensive. We know , we ’ re comparing apples to oranges , internal combustion to pure EV tech here , but still. Those who ’ ve got the dough will surely splurge , but which of these two six-figure SUVs would you prefer. The X5 M will get you from 0-60 mph in 4 seconds flat , but the Model X can get your there in 3.2 , but without the sound of that thunderous twin-turbo V8. Not to influence your opinion , but those rear falcon doors on the Tesla are just wicked cool ."
13,"Do you remember when a massive sinkhole swallowed eight historic Corvettes last year ? Well , fast forward to a year later and General Motors has finally finished restoring the 1 millionth Corvette C4. It ’ s taken approximately four months and 1,200 man-hours to get the Corvette back to its original glory , but we ’ d say the effort was definitely worth it. The vehicle was moved to GM ’ S Design ’ s Mechanical Assembly Group and Service Operations where 30 craftspeople , as well as technicians went to work on the vehicle. According to Mark Reuss General Motors Executive Vice President : “ When we disassembled it , we found that each employee involved in building it had signed a part of the car , which was fantastic and moving to see , ” stated Reuss. Even with the Corvette ’ s extensive damage , the team attempted to preserve and repair as many original components as possible , including the parts that carried a signature. Only two signed components were unable to be recovered , but the team managed to scan the autographs and transfer them onto the replacement parts. This is only the second Corvette to be restored by GM following the “ Blue Devil ” prototype and we have to say that the C4 looks better than ever ."
14,"Brabus has to be one of the craziest tuning companies around. Just how crazy is it ? The company has created this insane monster , the Brabus 850 6.0 Biturbo G63 Widestar. As its name would imply , the G63 Widestar packs an incredible turbocharged V8 engine that pumps out 838 hp and 1,069 lb-ft of torque. That ’ s an astonishing bump of approximately 200 hp and 300 lb-ft over the 6.0-liter V12 found in the already zany Mercedes-AMG G65 AMG. To create this ludicrous amount of power , Brabus has increased the original 5.5-liter V8 to 6.0 liters by boring out the cylinders and installing larger forged pistons. There ’ s a lot of other engine work under the hood , but the standard turbos have been replaced by larger compressor units , while intake and charge air pipes have been fitted with special “ gold heat reflection. ” For a deeper growl , the SUV has been fitted with a Brabus sport exhaust system with stainless steel dual-side tailpipes. Incredibly , the G63 Widestar can get to 62 mph in 4.0 seconds and is limited to a top speed of 162 mph. Look out for the Brabus 850 G63 Widestart at this year ’ s Frankfurt Motor Show ."
15,"If you ’ ve ever heard of NASCAR , then you know who Richard Petty is. “ The King ” is renowned for winning the NASCAR Championship seven times and now even has his own shop , as well as a museum. The racing legend has donated a special-built 2015 Ford Mustang , which features customizations by Petty-garage for auction. The entire proceedings from the vehicle will benefit the Paralyzed Veterans of America ( PVA ) non-profit organization. Even if you ’ re not a fan of American culture or NASCAR , this special Mustang is a sight to behold. This special Mustang features Petty ’ s infamous blue color combination made famous by his Plymouth Superbird. Petty ’ s garage signature rear spoiler , as well as three-piece HRE VMC forge aluminum wheels complement the two-tone Petty Blue and black paint job. Besides having an eye-catching exterior , the Mustang also features performance parts that make the coupe much faster. The Mustang has been fitted with a Roush TVS 2300 Supercharger with a cold-air intake and Magnaflow exhaust. The vehicle also comes with Petty-branded “ Big Brake Kit ” Willwood brakes and Petty ’ s garage front and rear coil-overs. The car is going on sale without reserve with Mecum Auctions at its Dallas Auction , from September 16-19 ."
16,"A gorgeous Continental Orange Porsche 918 Spyder with a Weissach package has popped up for sale at Porsche of San Diego. As you can tell by the photos , the specs on this hypercar are quite unique. Besides having an awesome paint job , the factory-installed Weissach package boosts the 918 ’ s performance by reducing the car ’ s curb weight by 99 pounds. This is accomplished by replacing the standard 918 wheels with magnesium units as well as installing a lighter brake system , light-weight ceramic wheel bearings , and titanium chassis bolts. The Porsche 918 Spyder is powered by a 4.6-liter V8 engine that , combined with a hybrid electric drive system , produces a total of 887 horsepower and 944 lb-feet of torque. The car also has a top speed of 214 mph and is capable of hitting 60 mph in a mere 2.5 seconds. This particular model is on sale for $ 150,000 over list price at $ 1.03 million. Thanks to Ryan Antisdel for the tip and photos ."
17,"The Dodge Viper ’ s future isn ’ t looking too good. As we ’ ve just learned , the Viper ’ s fate is now in question in light of contract negotiations between Fiat Chrysler and the United Auto Workers Union ; the Connor Avenue Assembly Plant , where the Viper is built , looks like it ’ s going to be shut down. The Viper will be phased out completely in 2017. No successor is planned , and the Challenger SRT Hellcat is still more powerful , not to mention cheaper. It , not the Viper , has become Dodge ’ s new halo model. Armed with that and combined with my incurable car geekiness ( think we can all relate ) and quest to make a profit , I researched some Viper prices. Not the latest model , but the original one Carroll Shelby consulted on back in the early 90s. Get this : you can buy a 1993 Viper RT/10 this very instant for less than $ 35,000. I even saw one for $ 29,000. Mileage ? Well below 50,000. Condition ? Excellent. Like any good fine wine , expect that value to increase in time – especially if Dodge gives the Viper the axe. A Phase II Viper GTS , built from 1995 through 2002 , is also a damn decent bargain. I found two for around $ 40k. And they were blue. With that Le Mans style racing stripe ."
18,"Anyone who has thrown a paper airplane in class has found out that aerodynamics play a huge factor in performance. Luckily , automotive engineers were airplane-throwing goofs. Every new model seems to feature new aerodynamic technology to optimize fuel economy or get top-of-the-line performance. Automakers have even designed active aero systems that change to best suit the aerodynamic needs of the car , but it has taken until now to for the aero obsession to make it to tires. Yokohama has just announced that it has successfully completed research on a type of technology that involves placing fins on the sidewall of the tire to reduce drag and improve fuel economy. Yokohama claims that this technology will soon be put into production. With automakers fighting for every extra mpg and racing teams striving to knock off every tenth of a second possible , we wouldn ’ t be surprised to see this technology appear on race cars and passenger cars in the next few years. Unfortunately for the bling-savvy , sidewall fins may take away from the aesthetics of shiny 22-inch rims ."
19,"Max Siedentopf is a Dutch artist and photographer who turns ordinary cars into supercars. Notice we didn ’ t describe him as a “ tuner ” because he doesn ’ t actually modify the engines or exteriors of the rides he works on. Instead , Siedentopf uses masking tape and cardboard to make ordinary econo boxes look like supercars … kind of. His project is called “ Slapdash Supercars ” and is kind of sketchy in that the cars involved all belong to strangers. So what motivates him to do this ? In an interview with Vice , the artist talked about how individuality and self-expression are seen as important in today ’ s world , yet the cars we drive often lack these things. “ But for some reason you see that things as ordinary as cars are getting personalized less and less , while it could be a strange but great form of self-expression. I thought I 'd do people a favor by giving them a custom-made supercar. "" So , the real question is this : If you woke up and found your not-so-hot hatch with a cardboard wing and hood scoop would it piss you off or make you laugh ? Let us know in the comments.

20,"The war for the fuel of the future is currently being waged by automakers and government agencies all around the world. Tesla and many other automakers are banking on electricity to drive the wheels of cars in the near future , but it seems that Toyota has other plans. Contrary to Elon Musk ’ s beliefs , Toyota thinks electric cars do not have much of a future. Instead , the Japanese automaker is counting on gas/electric hybrids to make up a small portion of the market and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles ( FCVs ) to dominate the roads by 2050. Toyota ’ s reasoning is that electric cars take too long to recharge and that once hydrogen takes off as a reliable fuel consumers will prefer it to battery power. Toyota faces major struggles if it wants to make a hydrogen revolution happen. The US Department of Energy says that there are only 12 hydrogen fuel stations in the U.S. while there are 10,976 electric charging stations , not including personal electrical outlets that EV owners could use as well. However , if a small automaker like Tesla can create its own formidable charging infrastructure , there is no telling what Toyota , one of the world ’ s largest automakers , could do when it flexes its muscles. The future of fuel is shaping up to be interesting ."
21,"The Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupe is already a sleek-looking car , but now the German luxury car manufacturer is expanding it with a new special range known as the “ Night Edition ” similar to what we saw in the equivalent AMG C63 Night model. Set to debut at the Detroit Auto Show next month , Night Edition models will come with a series of aesthetic flourishes. For starters , the distinctive radiator grille has been lavished in a high-gloss black finish. Likewise , the exclusive 20-inch AMG multi-spoke light-alloy wheels will also be black and feature a high-sheen rim flange. Elsewhere , the mirror housings and the inserts in the side sill panels will also be coated in high-gloss black. To give the S-Class Night Edition a sportier look , the front and rear aprons have been adapted from AMG ’ s bodystyling and come as standard. Further setting it apart from the standard model a “ Night Edition ” badge has been fitted to the front wings , along with illuminated door sills with Mercedes-Benz lettering to give it a premium look. Oh , and if the high-gloss black finish isn ’ t to your liking , don ’ t worry ."
22,"It ’ s that time of year when half of the continental US is on the verge of having school cancelled due to snow while the other half is considering digging their jackets out of the closet because it ’ s finally cool enough to show off the winter attire they bought last year. During this time , thousands of words are typed or printed onto pages urging those in the former half of the country to splurge on a set of winter tires. Instead of writing a novel about it , we thought we ’ d just bring you this video. Thanks to Engineering Explained , we have a slightly abridged version of the spiel that details both why it ’ s so important to buy these sorts of tires as well as what makes them so much better than summer or all-season rubber. As much as we ’ d like to think tread is the main difference , it actually goes deeper than that. That ’ s because both tread and tire compound are important for keeping a car on the road instead of careening off of the pavement during winter months. Think of summer and winter tires like a stick of butter with different melting points. Summer tires have a rubber compound that stays hard in moderate to high temperatures but doesn ’ t get so soft that it loses traction in the heat. The problem is that when it 's colder , summer tires turn into a traction-free rock. On the other hand , winter tires are engineered to keep that balance but at much lower temperatures , but can get too soft and lose grip if temperatures get too high ."
23,"With 2017 just around the corner , It 's that time of year when we take a look at some of the big reveals expected at the upcoming Detroit Auto Show. The show opens to the press on Monday , January 9 and to the public on Saturday , January 14 , running for nine straight days. Detroit is perhaps the biggest and most prominent car show in North America , but that does n't mean every carmaker will be there. Porsche has already announced that it wo n't attend but nonetheless there are plenty of cool reveals to look forward to. It would n't be the Detroit Auto Show if one of the big three American automakers did n't show off something awesome. Ford shocked the world when it revealed the 2017 GT in 2015 , and this year we think it will be GM 's turn given the recent spy shots of what we assume to be a C7 Corvette ZR-1. The prototype features an aggressive aerodynamics kit and a huge rear wing , so it will probably be a track monster. No one knows exactly what Corvette this will be or what will power it. It could be an updated version of the Z06 's LT4 with over 700 horsepower , or a new twin-turbo LT5 V8. Either way , we ca n't wait to find out ."
24,"Last year , Japanese automaker Mitsubishi closed its only North American factory in Illinois , despite improving sales. The plant was formerly used to build the Outlander Sport and was originally opened in 1988 as a joint venture with Chrysler. According to a report by Automotive News , a new company called Rivian Automotive is in talks to buy the plant. Rivian has plans to invest $ 175 million in the plant by 2024 and create 500 jobs by 2021 , according to a press release from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. Not much is currently known about Rivian Automotive , which was founded in 2009 by CEO RJ Scaringe , a graduate of RPI and MIT university. The company describes itself as "" developing an integrated portfolio of products and services to advance the shift to sustainable mobility. "" The mission is to create "" solutions that redefine traditional automotive economics and remove the pain points of conventional ownership. "" If you have any idea what that means , then let us know. We interpreted it as some kind of autonomous or sustainable drivetrain technology , but even the company 's website simply says "" Coming Soon "" while the state of Illinois does n't know what the company is planning either ."
25,"Unless you were a child art prodigy ( or even a halfway decent drawer ) , chances are that you drew your cars using a series of boxes. A small long box up front was for the hood of the car , a larger blocky box in the middle represented the passenger cabin , and at the rear there was one final box for the trunk. Add wheel arches underneath the front and rear box , wheels under those , and windows in the middle box and boom , you had a Crayola masterpiece for mom to tack onto the fridge. In case you didn ’ t notice , it ’ s a bit harder for kids to draw cars nowadays and it ’ s not for lack of talented children. Instead , you can put the blame on the auto industry for replacing the stout lines of the 80 ’ s to the curvaceous jelly beans of the 90 ’ s that altered the car ’ s silhouette forever. As much as we like to criticize the design of cars like the Ford Taurus of the mid 80 ’ s , it ’ s shapely lines are responsible for bringing rounded styling to cars in America. What ’ s more is that consumers could no longer afford to pay the price of ownership for boxier cars , which guzzled down gas at the pumps. Faced with increasingly strict fuel economy regulations , cars got even more round. Even today it ’ s possible to see how cars like the ultra low drag coefficient Tesla Model S are more rounded than some of the less efficient competition. Wherever this leads us , at least the styling of cars today is as good as we could hope for ."
26,"BMW ’ s M Division has been sacrilegiously butchering its lineup to a point that it could soon be unrecognizable from the first Ms that started the whole thing. First was the news that the M5 would be an all-wheel drive model , and next we heard that the Blue and White Roundel would begin electrifying its M cars until one day , we ’ d have nothing left but silent all-wheel drive track cars. Thankfully , Germany ’ s Bimmer Today has uncovered that the former of the two M Division sins would be mitigated. That ’ s because BMW is poised to make the F90 both a rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive car. Unlike BMW ’ s line of xDrive vehicles , the M5 won ’ t be sold in two models , one for each individual drivetrain flavor. Instead , the Bimmer will encapsulate both drive modes in one by adding a mode that sends 100 percent of the engine ’ s power to the rear wheels. This means that owners can have the benefit of AWD safety and control with the fun of a rear-wheel drive train all wrapped in one sleek package. This is similar to what Mercedes did with the new AMG E63 , which features a drift mode that sends all of the power to the rear wheels when the driver wants to send clouds of tire smoke into the air ."
27,"It must be Christmas , because the Aston Martin DB4 GT , one of the rarest and most revered grand tourers in Aston ’ s back catalogue from the 1960 ’ s , is making a surprise comeback for the first time in over 50 years. The British automaker announced it will be building ‘ continuation ’ models of the legendary grand tourer , which is cause for excitement. There is a catch , though : only 25 are being built. Oh , and you won ’ t get it in time for Christmas , because they aren ’ t expected to be delivered until Summer 2017. The limited run mirrors Aston ’ s original production plans for the DB4 GT as only 25 were originally intended to be made , but this was increased up to 75 during its production between 1959 and 1963. Visually , the DB4 GT Continuation remains faithful to its 1960 ’ s counterpart , which hasn ’ t aged a day – it ’ s even being built in the same factory as the original. Better still , the revamped DB4 GT will be based on the ultra-rare lightweight model , only eight of which formed part of the original 75. To bring the DB4 GT up to modern-day standards , Aston Martin has fitted the continuation model with a raft of upgrades ."
28,"We ’ ve known for some time now that Lamborghini is making an SUV. Called the Urus , it was initially revealed as a concept at the 2012 Bejing Auto Show and is rumored to be powered by a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V8 generating 600 hp. It looked stunning too , with a striking design that was still unmistakably Lamborghini. It isn ’ t meant to go on sale until 2018 and a production model has yet to be revealed , but it looks like a test model of the SUV has been spotted out in the wild. Top Gear Magazine ’ s Rowan Horncastle spotted what appears to be a test mule of the Urus parked at the Munich airport , sharing a photo on Twitter. To the untrained eye , the camouflage makes it look like an ordinary SUV you wouldn ’ t look twice at , but take a closer look at the grille , and you can clearly see the word ‘ Lamborghini ’ lurking on the wrapping. It ’ s difficult to judge without being able to see the bare bodywork , but the shape of the test mule doesn ’ t look quite as striking as the original concept we saw four years ago , unsurprisingly , clearly taking design inspiration from other SUVs in the Volkswagen family such as the Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne ."
29,"A slow sense of panic is already starting to set in for those who make their living driving cars for transportation because as we keep hearing , the autonomous car will strip away jobs from taxi drivers , truck drivers , delivery drivers , and more. However , they may not be the only ones that could be wiped out during the transition. As Bloomberg so eloquently stated , the auto industry itself could be poised for a massive consolidation that could see many of the large name brands we know today collapse. The reason why is that currently , automakers distinguish themselves in a number of ways , and styling aside , one of the most prominent means of doing so is with driving style. It ’ s the way a car feels when it drives that guides a buyer to their choice ride , which is why brands set up an entire identity behind their driving styles. Cars like the Honda Accord feel solid and make driving feel easy , albeit with no frills. On the other hand , cars like the Volkswagen Jetta feel as if they could be telepathic while Lexus tends to skew towards lofty comfort. None of this will matter once a car can drive itself. “ In the long term , automotive brands are gone , ” said retired General Motors Vice Chairman Bob Lutz ."
30,"Is this the scariest SUV in existence ? The hair-raising V8 Hellcat engine that powers the likes of the Dodge Charger and Challenger muscle cars is one of the best-sounding engines money can buy – there ’ s a reason why it reduced Richard Hammond to an excitable child every time he floored it in The Grand Tour and was treated to its sublime supercharged whine. Likewise , the Jeep Wrangler is one of the most capable off-roaders money can buy. So why not have both ? That ’ s exactly what this auto shop is offering. And the resulting Frankenstein creation is one scary SUV. Dakota Customs is offering to do the insane conversion , fitting your Wrangler with the same 6.2-liter , 707-hp HEMI V8 engine from the aforementioned muscle cars , no detuning necessary. You ’ ll also get some extras as part of the package , including a Borla exhaust system , a Walbro fuel pump and Dakota Customs ’ own intake and intercooler. Unsurprisingly , the cost to fit these upgrades doesn ’ t come cheap , and will set you back $ 56,000. And no , that doesn ’ t include the cost of a Wrangler. You can also add a rear tray to match the Trailcat concept that never happened for an extra $ 5,895. Since the Trailcat most likely isn ’ t going to go into production , this is probably the closest you ’ re going to get right now. It ’ s worth noting that Daktoa Customs advises that the mod is only intended to be used off-road , as it may no longer pass state emissions tests. That ’ s a bit of an understatement ."
31,"We knew the Lamborghini Aventador SV was going to be a limited edition thing. Specifically , Lamborghini planned to build exactly 600 examples. Revealed only a couple of months ago at Geneva , we ’ re now hearing through various sources that all Aventador SVs have sold out. Lamborghini apparently offered 200 units to each of the following three global regions : North and South America ; Asia Pacific ; and Europe , Middle East and Africa. In other words , you ’ ll be much more likely to see the standard Aventador than an SV on the road. So what made the Aventador SV so special for it to sell out this fast ? Power from its V12 has increased to 750 hp thanks to a redesigned valvetrain and a freer-flowing exhaust system. Redline is now up at 8,500 rpm , 0-62 mph takes only 2.8 seconds , and top speed is now at 217 mph. All told , 110 lbs. has been shaved off thanks to an abundant use of carbon fiber elements. Total weight : 3,362 lbs. So , how much would an Aventador SV cost you if you managed to snag one ? Nearly $ 500,000. But don ’ t be too sad if you missed out , because we ’ ve also heard that an Aventador SV Roadster is on the way ."
32,"Anyone interested in stealing a car one day , let this be a lesson on how not to do it. A 37-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly breaking into a San Francisco BMW dealer in the middle of the night and attempting to steal not one , but two cars. The guy first tried to steal a 5 Series after finding the keys in the locked box. He then drove and smashed through the glass window in a failed attempt to escape. With that plan now a no-go , he snatched the keys to a Frozen Red M3 worth about $ 100,000 ( thanks to a $ 15k dealer markup ) . This time he managed to ram it through a side window and take off , but not without causing damage to the car itself. Five minutes later , police responded to a hit and run report. The thief , who had by then smashed into a parked taxi , took off on foot. The taxi driver , who was sleeping inside , wasn ’ t seriously hurt. About an hour later , police responded to another call of a domestic violence dispute between a man and woman. Guess who the man turned out to be ? The thief was then taken into custody. The family who owns the dealership claims they ’ ve never had a break-in of this magnitude in over 60 years of business. The M3 ? Well , see the before and after pics ahead ."
33,"Markus Storck loves Aston Martin ’ s ‘ Q ’ bespoke personalization division so much , he ’ s commissioned them to build seven custom cars for him and his mates. Founder and head of hi-tech bicycle maker Storck Bikes , Mr. Storck has asked the Q by Aston Martin team to create the ‘ One of Seven ’ Vanquish sports car series : one for himself and the rest for fellow sports car fans. Bespoke features on the cars include an exclusive exterior finish using multiple layers of carbon fiber , interwoven for a smooth finish , with exposed carbon and satin Jet Black. Inside , diamond quilted seats and machined carbon wing badges combine with logos and gloss black trim. Speaking of the project , Markus Storck said : “ I ’ m absolutely thrilled to see my vision for a series of bespoke Aston Martin Vanquish come to life like this. The attention to detail , service and dedication I have seen from the Q team has been exceptional – and the result is outstanding. ”"
34,"When it debuted last November at the LA Auto Show , Ford didn ’ t release exact power output specs of its new Shelby GT350 Mustang. The same deal also went for the more track-focused GT350R during its reveal at Detroit. Powered by an also brand-spanking new 5.2-liter flat-plane-frank V8 , Ford only said to expect output to be more than 500 hp and 400 lb-ft of torque for both versions. But today we finally have the exact numbers. Ford has just announced that the 2016 Shelby GT350 and GT350R will have a total of 526 hp at 7,500 rpm and 429 lb-ft of torque at 4,750 rpm. Do the math and you ’ ll see that ’ s 102 hp per liter , making this engine the most powerful naturally aspirated V8 Ford has ever built. Compared to the Camaro Z/28 , the GT350 and GT350R have an additional 21 hp , but have 52 lb-ft less torque. As we also previously reported , the Shelby GT350 will have a base price of $ 47,870 while the GT350R will go for $ 61,370. Considering the total output , that ’ s one helluva deal. Only in America ."
35,"Following our report from a few days ago , Las Vegas-based PSC Motors has officially revealed renderings of its upcoming hybrid hypercar – an all-American monster that happens to have been designed by a 15-year-old Thai kid. The SP-200 SIN 's production run , which is still in early stages of development , will be limited to 35 units. So what will those lucky buyers get when this dream becomes a reality ? According to PSC , the mid-mounted 9.0-liter V8 will produce 1000 hp , in addition to a rear-wheel electric motor making 700 hp. These will be mated to an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission , allowing the SP-SIN to reach a top speed of 280 mph and sprint from 0-60 in just 2.8 seconds. The car 's carbon fiber and aluminum space frame will be wrapped in this stunning design , which includes slim headlights , an intense splitter and huge air intakes. Also noticeable are its wheel arch-mounted wing mirrors and side air intakes. The rear is home to a clear engine cover and large diffuser. And while 15-year-old Jennarong Muengtaweepongsa has already proven himself as a talented rendering artist ( remember the Aston DB11 design study ? ) , PSC Motors promises a production version as early as 2016 ."
36,"Having a built up a sizeable collection of pristine BMW M5s , a German car collector has decided it ’ s time to cash in on his prized possessions , with no less than seven examples of the super sedan headed to the Classic Car Auctions sale this weekend. Up first is a couple of BMW E28s. Only one is a bona fide M5 ( red ) , the other is actually a M535i , but is still a sought-after model. The authentic E28 was the fastest sedan on the planet when it launched , with power coming from a 3.5-liter inline-six borrowed from the M1 and rated at 282 hp. It comes with 176,000 miles on the clock. A pair of E34 sedans and a wagon ( Touring ) are up next , and like the E28 , were hand built. The wagon is one of just 891 ever made , while power comes from a 335-hp 3.8-liter inline-six. That same engine powers the black sedan , but the Macao blue metallic model , complete with 17-inch turbine rims , boasts a 311-hp 3.6-liter unit. The final two M5s are the Imola Red E39 , with a 394-hp 4.9-liter V8 and aluminum suspension , and an E60 M5 25th anniversary edition model. Arguably the most valuable of the collection , it comes in Frozen Silver Metallic and is one of just 25 ever built. Power comes from a Formula 1-inspired 5.0-liter V10 rated at 500 horses ."
37,"Last week Dodge teased its Vision Gran Turismo concept car , the SRT Tomahawk. Now the automaker has delivered in full , showing all three versions of the SRT Tomahawk. That ’ s right , three trims were developed for gamers to race in “ Gran Turismo 6. ” The concept is meant to show what Dodge will be capable of in the year 2035. So , what does Dodge have planned for that year ? For starters , the SRT Tomahawk will sport a V10 that drives the rear wheels. Along with the V10 there is what Dodge has dubbed a “ variable-fin quad-stage pneumatic power unit ” that releases compressed air to drive the front wheels. The compressed air is also used to activate aerodynamic panels that assist with braking and traction. The three versions of the SRT Tomahawk are : the entry level S , racing-spec GTS-R and the experimental X. The S drops 1,007 horsepower with a top speed of 250 mph. The GTS-R has a curb weight of just 1,459 pounds and 1,450 horsepower. The X is good for a 2,590 horsepower and an insane top speed of 404 mph. No word on when the SRT Tomahawk will be available for download ."
38,"BMW calls them Sports Activity Vehicles , as opposed to SUVs or crossovers. And that ’ s just fine because they sell an awful lot of them. Presenting the all-new , second generation X1. Unlike the first generation , the 2016 X1 doesn ’ t look quite as much like a tall wagon. It ’ s now sleeker and more closely resembles the rest of the BMW SAV lineup. Perhaps one of the most noticeable and best design changes is the front end , which has a more prominent look than before. The grille is bolder and the LED headlights are a welcome touch. The body overall has a "" beefier "" look thanks to additional plastic cladding and a tailgate-mounted spoiler. Opt for the top-end M Sport styling package and you ’ ll also get an aerodynamic body kit and 18-inch lightweight alloy wheels along with Alcantara-trimmed sport seats inside. The interior itself is also a solid improvement. With a 6.5-inch display , occupants will enjoy optional bits such as Dakota leather seats and Fineline Stream or Oak grain wood trim. Other new interior features include a new heads-up display and Driving Assistant Plus package with Active Cruise Control , Lane Departure Warning , and several other electronic safety equipment ."
39,"So what could possibly go wrong when a massive PTL-02 tank destroyer accidentally crashes into a tiny yellow Porsche Cayman sports car ? Well , a lot , but in this case the pictures of the accident seem to tell a different story. Surprisingly , the tough little Porsche Cayman looks like it emerged from the accident practically unscathed. Although it is hard to tell what happened to the left front end of the vehicle. Also , more importantly , the passengers in the Porsche escaped without a scratch. One might ask where in the world such an accident could even possibly occur and how it unfolded. The accident occurred in of all places , China , in the great city of Congqing. Apparently the tank destroyer wanted to change lanes and went barreling straight into the side of the bright yellow Cayman. The reason for the accident may have something to do with the tank destroyer ’ s lack of turn signals. It does however come fully equipped with a monstrous 100 millimeter cannon that can be used to destroy enemy tanks from long distances. Thankfully for the Porsche , no one was destroyed in the accident. Pictures sourced from e23 and Weixinyidu ."
40,"We ’ ve all seen replica , aka fake , Ferraris over the years. Most of them suck , and you may wonder how anyone is ballsy enough to drive them around. However , there are some that , honestly , really aren ’ t all that bad. In fact , the work done to the donor car is even commendable. Typical donor cars can range from a Corvette to a Toyota MR2 Spyder to even a Nissan 300ZX. And there ’ s always the Pontiac Fiero for any fake supercar transformation needs. But we found 10 replica Ferraris that really do look pretty good , considering they ’ re fakes and all. Nothing like taking a perfectly good C4 Corvette and turning it into the Testarossa convertible that never existed ( except on "" Miami Vice , "" and it was white ) . Ferrari 360 Modena ? Nope , it ’ s really a Toyota MR2 Spyder. Wait , is that a Ferrari F430. Not quite. Try a Mercury Cougar ."
41,"Last March at Geneva , Aston Martin unveiled its Vantage GT3 , a track-tuned V12-engined supercar that ’ s , more or less , the ultimate culmination of the Vantage lineup. Then Porsche made it known that it owns the rights to the "" GT3 "" name , thus forcing AM to rename its car the Vantage GT12. And now all 100 planned units have apparently been sold. No one should be in the least bit surprised here. After all , AM only added bits such as an aggressive carbon-fiber wide body kit , modified bumpers , revised side skirts and beefier fenders. The hood ? Entirely carbon fiber. And that engine. Oh , that lustrous 6.0-liter V12. It spits out 591 hp and 460 lb-ft of torque and comes mated to a seven-speed automated manual transmission. 0-62 mph ? 3.7 seconds. Top speed ? 185 mph. All that power and less weight , too. In fact , the Vantage GT12 weighs about 220 lbs. less than the V12 Vantage S. No wonder why all 100 were sold so quickly ."
42,"If you are serious about being Batman then you will need to get yourself a Batmobile. Amazingly , the most badass ride the Caped Crusader ever drove is up for sale with a Dubai-based dealer. Priced at just over $ 1,000,000 , the Tumbler wannabe comes with a 5.7-liter V8 borrowed from a Corvette with 500 hp on tap helping it hit 62 mph in less than six seconds and reach a top speed of 155 mph. That should be more than enough to scare off the bad guys. Propane tanks enable it to shoot flames out the rear. It sits on 18.5-inch Hoosier tires at the front and 44-inch super swamper tires at the back. Other features include LED headlights and multiple cameras dotted around the vehicle to ensure excellent visibility. It 's currently for sale at GTR Motors in Dubai , and you can book a test drive first to see how you get on before laying out the seven-figure asking price ."
43,"Since the moment it went on sale in 2014 , there ’ s been lots of speculation as to whether BMW will build an even more powerful version of its i8 hybrid sports car. Officials from its famed M division have repeatedly denied that the i8 will be sent their way. However , BMW ’ s 100th anniversary is happening next year and a proper celebration will be in order. We ’ re hearing there are a few projects in the works , and now , according to Auto Express , a more hardcore version of the i8 can be added to that list. But here ’ s the thing : it won ’ t be an M car. An inside source told Auto Express that engineers from the "" i "" division are anxious to "" showcase the capabilities of the i8 ’ s lightweight carbon fiber structure "" as well as its plug-in hybrid drivetrain. Supposedly , the i8 can handle up to an additional 300 hp. Its drivetrain consists of a 1.5-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine and an electric motor with a combined output of 357 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque. Rumor has it that engineers are testing a 2.0-liter four-banger with over 300 hp , thus bringing total output to about 450 hp. To counteract the added weight of a larger engine , the car will feature unpainted carbon-fiber body panels and a stripped-out interior. A hardcore i8 does have a lot of potential and BMW has an ideal reason to build it ."
44,"When Audi presented the all-new R8 V10 at the Geneva Motor Show this year , it was taking the next step into the big leagues. Preparing to fight some of the toughest luxury and performance vehicles in its segment , Audi had to find that delicate balance between crushing power , a tremendous driving experience and the beauty of opulence and indulgence. Now , taking this harmony to a whole new level , Audi Exclusive is presenting this incredible R8. A stunning creation on the outside , it only gets better when you step inside. Audi Exclusive has really gone all out with this design , dressing the R8 V10 with ten-spoke forged aluminum wheels with Y-design , a Carbon Gloss engine cover and sumptuous Santorini Blue paint. Step inside the car and you 'll find an incredible interior , with Audi Exclusive 's full leather package featuring Havana Brown leather , Piano Black finish on all other elements , diamond quilting on the seats and an Alcantara roof with black contrast stitching. The car is currently on display at Audi Forum Neckarsulm , and we think it might be one of the finest-looking , and certainly most luxurious , R8s of the new generation ."
45,"The Goodwood Festival of Speed is happening later this month in West Sussex , England , and we ’ ll be there on the ground to bring you awesome coverage and photos of what ’ s without question one of the coolest and most exclusive auto shows in Europe , perhaps the world. This is where you ’ ll find plenty of Ferraris , Lamborghinis , Porsches , Jaguars , and everything else expensive on display and/or doing the notorious Goodwood Hill Climb. But did you notice that none of those aforementioned brands are American ? Chevrolet certainly did , and that ’ s why it ’ ll be bringing the Corvette Z06 to the event. You know , just to remind the UK of 239 years of American Independence. Funnily enough , however , GM is currently phasing the Chevrolet brand out of Europe , so those in the Old World looking to get some New World V8 awesomeness ( read : no forced induction ) will have to buy a new C7 Corvette from a Cadillac dealer instead. The 2015 Goodwood Festival of Speed will happen from June 26 to 28 ."
46,"The S2000 is one of the most beloved models Honda has ever produced. The sporty little rear-wheel drive roadster was incredibly popular with import fans when it was on the market. Moreover , even after the car was discontinued in 2009 it still managed to maintain a die-hard cult following. The reason for the avid fanfare over the S2000 was for its fusion of performance , handling and beautiful design in such a neat little package. Well , if speculation is accurate , S2000 fans may have something new to be excited about. Patent renderings filed by Honda with the US Patent office have surfaced of what could be a new S2000 design. The renderings appear to look very similar to the NSX , only with a smaller body. So alternatively this could actually be a smaller NSX that could be added to the Honda line up. What seems more likely however is that this is indeed a newly designed S2000. Whatever the car is , it clearly has some fresh modern styling and will be a mid-engine vehicle. We look forward to any confirmation of what this new Honda patent rendering could be ."
47,"Bugatti has carved out a solid reputation for developing some of the most pristine vehicles in the world. Each finished Bugatti is practically a work of art. The Bugatti Veyron , for example , has an engine that is entirely assembled by hand. In fact , it takes the Bugatti craftsmen more than an entire week to build a single engine for the Veyron. With such high standards when it comes to producing vehicles , it goes without saying that anything Bugatti lays its hands on will be refined into a masterpiece. For this reason , this latest Bugatti concept is incredibly exciting. Not only because , if produced , the concept would bear the coveted Bugatti logo , but because of what the concept is. British designer , Fraser Leid ’ s concept for a Bugatti Atlantean Racing Yacht has introduced the French hypercar brand to entirely new territory. Although the yacht design was not directly commissioned by Bugatti , Leid ’ s initiative is definitely sleek enough to be taken seriously. The design for what we have dubbed the “ Buyachti , ” takes cues from the Bugatti Type 57 of the 1930s. Let ’ s hope that we get to see one of these in real life in the near future ."
48,"As the Veyron reached the end of its 450-unit limited run , Bugatti launched the six-part Legend series of uniquely modified Gran Sport Vitesse models specifically for collectors. The Meo Constantini , named after the head of Bugatti ’ s factory race team and friend of Ettore Bugatti , was the third in the series and was limited to just three units. To say this supercar is rare would be a colossal understatement , yet one is currently up for sale with Dubai dealer Deals on Wheels , priced at 9.9 million AED , or $ 2.7 million. The Meo Constantini is painted in France ’ s classic racing blue and features styling reminiscent of the Type 35 Bugatti in which Constantini himself raced as well as a painted silhouette of the original Targa Florio race course located on the underside of the rear wing. The interior is equipped with bespoke leather trim with unique blue stitching , while the seats are embroidered with Constantini ’ s signature and an aluminum plate pays tribute to the Targa Florio route. Like other Vitesse models , power comes from a 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine rated at 1,200 hp ."
49,"This sucker weighs 5,000 lbs. and costs more than the average house in the US. And yet you can walk into any Mercedes dealership right now and place an order for one. Assuming you ’ ve got the dough , that is. With its 6.0-liter twin-turbo V12 producing 621 hp and 738 lb-ft of torque , the Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG Coupe is a hell of a thing. Is it fast ? Oh yeah , but that ’ s not the main reason why people buy them. Step inside one and you ’ ll immediately understand. Motor Trend ’ s Jonny Lieberman claims the S65 ’ s interior is so incredible that it may only be surpassed by that of the Pagani Huayra 's. Now , the S65 ’ s main competitors are Bentleys and Rolls-Royces , two brands which are known for luxurious extravagance. So is this the most insanely luxurious big coupe you can buy ? It ’ ll cost you $ 250k to find out ."
50,"Talking on the phone while behind the wheel of your car is not cool. But nor is telling a complete stranger to “ Put down your f * * * ing phone. ” Motorcyclist , Samuel Ayres , was approaching a red light when he noticed the BMW driver next to him talking on his phone. The LA biker ’ s aggressive request to put his phone down can be heard in the video he recorded from his helmet-mounted camera. Would asking more politely have resulted in a different outcome ? We ’ ll never know , but what ’ s not in doubt is that moments later Ayres was knocked off his bike , bumped and bruised with a severe concussion , two hairline fractures and a broken foot. Did the BMW driver knock into the biker on purpose ? Or was he distracted because he was , ironically , talking on the same phone the biker had seconds before told him to put down ?"
51,"The McLaren P1 is one hot hypercar and certainly doesn ’ t require any extra customization or modification to make it any better. The P1 is simply a masterpiece. However , even though asthetic customizations are definitely not necessary on such an awesome hypercar , every so often we do spot customized McLarens that stand out even more than normal. This chrome-wrapped P1 spotted in London is a perfect example of a customized hypercar done well. In addition to the gorgeous chrome wrap that surrounds the entire car , there are also some sweet orange accent lines that add a nice layer of extra detail. There are also some pretty sweet chrome rims that make the wheels blend seamlessly with the body color. This sort of flashy style may not be for everyone , but it definitely gets our seal of approval ."
52,"Although it may not look like it at first glance , this 1971 Chevrolet Monte Carlo has a six-figure price tag. How much , exactly ? $ 100,000 , but the seller claims it has the potential to be worth upwards of $ 1 million. We ’ re not so sure of that , but the car itself is damn cool anyway.

53,"Ford has been kicking ass and taking names as of late , and now it has a new accomplishment to crow about. For the first time since 2009 the Mustang is outselling the Chevy Camaro. According to The Detroit News , 56,571 Mustangs have been moved in the first five months of 2015. That absolutely wrecks the Camaro ’ s total sales figures of 33,982 units. As you guessed , the Dodge Challenger has come in third with 30,166 cars sold through the end of May. Winning sales battles is always a good thing but Ford had outside help. For starters it introduced a new Mustang last year , and an updated version this year , while Chevy stood pat. The new Camaro recently bowed at Belle Isle but it ’ s still not available to consumers. Dodge likely helped steal a few Camaro customers with its new Hellcat package. What is surprising are the engine options that helped put the Mustang over the top. A whopping 35 percent of new Mustang buyers are millennials , and they prefer the 2.3-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost Mustang to its big V8 counterpart ."
54,"Bentley is already adding an SUV to its lineup , the oddly named Bentayga , but now new reports are out that another model is in the pipes. Just what type of car that will be remains a mystery , although a new report from Autocar is shedding some light on the story. Apparently the race is between the EXP 10 Speed 6 concept shown off at this year ’ s Geneva motor show and a sub-Bentayga SUV ( think the Porsche Macan ) . Kevin Rose , Bentley ’ s sales and marketing head , is undertaking the task of building a business case for each. Autocar says Rose ’ s decision isn ’ t expected until 2017 at the latest. Just know that Bentley boss Wolfgang Durheimer can only choose one. "" We can ’ t do both those cars at the same time , because Bentley is still a small company and our resources are very stretched. ” Durheimer went on to say that Bentley ’ s customers want the EXP 10 Speed 6 to be built. Despite their pleas , a smaller SUV would make more financial sense. That being said the world has a shortage of two-seat luxury sports cars. Make it happen , Bentley !"

56,"Some time ago we brought you video of a Ferrari 458 Speciale that had wrecked on the Nurburgring. The car was totaled and the gearheads of the world let out a sigh before moving on with their lives. Now the owner of that wrecked 458 is back , and he wants you to help fix his car. Apparently the repair bill came to $ 233,982 , which the owner has decided to raise via crowdfunding. But wait , you get more than just karma points for fixing this car ! The team behind The Dead Ferrari made this helpful video to help educate prospective donors. Check it out to see why you should help out. While this idea is certainly novel it ’ s still ridiculous. Why help a supercar owner fix his car , especially when your reward is a tiny bit of photo space on either the hood or body ? Apparently 5,000-plus people will see your photo every day , which seems impossible as that would make this Ferrari a daily driver. The only real reward is the chance to drive the repaired Ferrari for a month free of charge. Hell , even that 's hard to attain as the raffle wo n't occur unless 50,000 people donate to the project. What 's nice is that all donors get an invite to a party at the Nurburgring , where they 'll be able to network and mingle with like-minded suckers ."
57,"When it comes to boats , we tend to appreciate them from afar. But sometimes a boat 's car connections are ignored , such as this wonderfully restored Riva Aquarama. It was ordered by Ferruccio Lamborghini , the founder of Lamborghini. The original Aquarama was powered by two V8 engines , but this boat packs two V12s originally found in the 350GT. That was the first engine ever put into a Lamborghini production car. We covered the GT350 in our “ Grand Touring Icons ” series , so we won ’ t get into too much detail about it. As for the boat , it ’ s been lovingly restored to its original condition. Although the engines are old they ’ re still good for a top speed of 48 knots ( 55 mph ) , a bump from the twin-V8 ’ s top speed of 40 knots ( 46 mph ) . No sale price is listed , but if you have to ask then you probably can ’ t afford it. For those who fall into that category ( likely everyone who reads this ) there ’ always awesome pictures to ogle and enjoy ."

59,"Unveiled in Japan by Subaru Tecnica International ( STI ) , this is the BRZ tS that the carmaker has dubbed the “ STI complete car ( sic ) . ” While the 2.0-liter four-pot remains unchanged , continuing to pack a 200-hp punch , the new higher spec model does come with an STI-tuned suspension , revised damping , a flexible front draw stiffener and a bigger drive shaft. Other mods to the chassis include Brembo brakes housed in black 18-inch rims , a specially-tuned Vehicle Dynamics Control , and custom filter for the Sound Creator. The body has been upgraded with a new under spoiler , bumpers , front fender and shark fin antenna , while the cabin boasts a bespoke speedometer , push button ignition , Recaro bucket seats , leather-wrapped steering wheel and carbon-fiber trim. Production of the BRZ tS STI will be limited to 300 units priced from $ 32,600 , and will be available in Crystal White Pearl , Crystal Black Silica and Sunrise Yellow ."
60,"Since “ The Fast and the Furious ” debuted in 2001 , the franchise as a whole has earned nearly $ 4 billion worldwide at the box office. After the massive success of “ Furious 7 , ” star Vin Diesel has already confirmed that “ Furious 8 ” is on the way. In fact , co-stars Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham have already stated they ’ re coming back as well. But Universal Studios wants to keep the money rolling in with the franchise in addition to the movies. Presenting Fast & Furious – Supercharged , a new ride at Universal Studios Hollywood. Described as a 360 degree experience with hydraulic tech that ’ s similar to Disney World ’ s Star Tours , you ’ re right there as Dom Torretto chases Owen Shaw through the streets of LA. Several other “ Furious ” characters also make appearances. But everything is somewhat toned down compared to the moves. It ’ s a kids ’ ride after all ."
61,"There was a time when Ferdinand Piech , the 78-year-old grandson of Ferdinand Porsche ( yes , the guy who founded Porsche ) was assumed to be all-powerful and couldn ’ t be touched. This wasn ’ t a guy to mess with because , after all , he was chairman of the board for Volkswagen for more than 20 years. Piech and the Porsche family actually control 51 percent of Volkswagen. But in a showdown with VW CEO Martin Winterkorn that began last week , Ferdinand Piech has now officially lost. Piech just resigned as chairman in a dramatic boardroom brawl. The guy has been known to literally destroy anyone who gets in his way , specifically VW executives who he felt attempted to double-cross him ; he personally ousted the two previous VW CEOs. But this time was different. In a five-to-one vote of VW ’ s steering committee , Piech lost the confidence of his board , which clearly had more trust in Winterkorn as the company is in the process of restructuring itself. Even his own cousin , Wolfgang Porsche , voted against him. So yeah , shit just became a little more awkward at the Porsche family dinner table ."
62,"There may not be a prettier Vette out there than the recently announced Z06 C7.R Edition. As its name suggests , this special edition is modeled after the C7.R endurance racer. To that end it sports the Corvette ’ s yellow racing livery , although it is also available in black. It can be had in either coupe or convertible and automatic or manual. The engine was left untouched , which isn ’ t an issue as the 6.2-liter LT4 V8 is no slouch as this recent video shows. Although the engine was left stock the C7.R Edition does get the Z07 Performance Package. This includes Michelin Pilot Super Sport Cup 2 tires , carbon ceramic brakes and adjustable aerodynamic bits at the front and back. The carbon fiber hood is also new and looks especially fetching. Only 500 of these bad boys will be made and Chevrolet has yet to announce pricing. Then again , if you have to ask you probably can ’ t afford it ."
63,"China is filled with some bizarre custom cars. The country ’ s craftsmen and women can make just about anything using a bit of scrap and a lot of imagination. The latest crazy Chinese offering is this helicopter car called China ’ s Dream. Whether or not the Chinese dream of flying cars at night is up for debate. What isn ’ t up for debate is that this wannabe helicopter can ’ t fly. That being said , it ’ s still pretty cool as far as custom cars go , and even cooler as far as custom helicopters go. Its creator , Yuan Jingying , originally designed it to pick up his grandson from school and to drive around with his mom. It took five years to build , but that was time well spent as it has a massive cabin and air conditioning. Oh , it also appears to be controlled by a computer ! Who knows , in another five years it might even be able to fly ."
64,"We ’ re just over a month away from the official debut of the all-new , sixth-generation Chevrolet Camaro. May 16 is the official reveal date and Chevy is apparently planning quite a show. In the meantime , sales of is biggest rival , the also redesigned Ford Mustang , have been quite solid. As with the outgoing model , Chevy intends for its replacement to continue outselling the Mustang once production and sales are fully underway. In fact , the smack talk has already begun. None other than GM VP of Global Product , Mark Reuss , is the one already predicting the new Camaro will be the better of the two pony cars. Speaking to Fox News at the New York Auto Show , Reuss stated that he ’ s "" very confident "" the '16 Camaro is superior. In fact , he said he ’ d just driven both back-to-back , and is sure the new Camaro is "" more efficient , faster and better handling than the Mustang. "" We ’ ll have our answer soon enough ."
65,"Perhaps we ’ re getting just a tad bit ahead of ourselves here. We ’ re not political analysts or professional pollsters , after all. But if we had to place our bets on the subject today , we ’ d say there ’ s a decent enough chance the next US president will be none other than Hillary Clinton. ( Almost ) welcome back to the White House , Bill. Anyway , we reported well over a year ago that whoever is the next occupant of the Oval Office will also be given a new presidential limousine. The vehicle currently known as "" The Beast "" will be retired. President Obama ’ s limo really is just that : a 10,000 pound vehicle with five-inch thick , bullet-proof protective armor. It can withstand a missile and chemical weapons attack. It may have Cadillac emblems and styling , but underneath is a commercial truck platform. It was rumored a few months ago that Cadillac was going to have some competition to build the next presidential limo , but now we can confirm Lincoln won ’ t be in the running. Ford CEO Mark Fields told The Detroit News that the automaker has opted not to bid for the next generation presidential limo. No specific reason was given but it ’ s kind of too bad. We ’ d loved to have seen the new Continental Concept turned into "" The Beast : Part 2. """
66,"It was going to happen at some point. We accepted it and kept reminding ourselves that change can be good. Or it can just outright suck. In case you haven ’ t already noticed , the official Top Gear website ( no , NOT Top Gear USA ) has just made perhaps the biggest change since 2003 : The images of Jeremy Clarkson , Richard Hammond , and James May have been removed from the website. Gone. Finito. Likely forever. Only The Stig remains on the top banner of each page. That ’ s what happens when one host ’ s contract isn ’ t renewed by the BBC , while the other two hosts refuse to renew theirs because the former ’ s wasn ’ t. As of now no one is exactly sure what the BBC ’ s next move will be , but it ’ s been assured Top Gear will continue , only with new hosts. Yeah , we weren ’ t totally shocked to their images removed ( still appears on Top Gear Middle East , interestingly ) but it ’ s still a bit hard to take knowing Top Gear as we know it is finished. All good things must come to an end ."
67,"Every now and then a TV commercial comes along that offends someone , somewhere. Some may actually find it funny , while others think it ’ s outright stupid. But it ’ s the ones who are offended that make the most noise. And now BMW is caught up in bit of controversy over its new X3 commercial that may get bounced from the NCAA men ’ s basketball tournament telecasts. If you ’ re watching the games ( go Duke ! ) then you ’ ve likely already seen "" Cute Cottage , "" a 30-second ad for the new X3. A couple is shown driving to what they thought was going to be a pleasant bed and breakfast. It turns out to be the complete opposite , with a crazy-looking woman on the doorsteps to greet them. That last part didn ’ t go over so well for some. The CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health wrote to BMW demanding the commercial ’ s immediate ouster from the airwaves. BMW responded to AdFreak , who first wrote about this story , in that it was "" deeply sorry to anyone that was offended by this ad , as it was certainly not our intention. The ad was intended to spoof a horror movie. "" Furthermore , the "" ad is naturally starting to run out of our ad-buy rotation. "" So , did BMW go overboard here or are some people just too sensitive ?"
68,"Back in 2012 fans of the affordable , RWD , sport coupe were beside themselves with joy : Scion and Subaru were launching the then all-new FR-S and BRZ twins , respectively. For just around $ 25k , you could essentially get the fixed hardtop MX-5 Miata Mazda didn ’ t build , only with a small rear seat ( you know , to keep insurance costs down ) . Fast forward to today and those two automakers have sadly realized there aren ’ t as many sports coupe fans as they thought ; sales for both cars have failed to reach targets. While not outright failures , the segment revival Toyota and Subaru were hoping for didn ’ t happen. But just as those cars were being launched , we saw a few other concepts pop up from the likes of Chevrolet and Nissan , with the Code 130R and IDx , respectively. While Nissan is still supposedly trying to make the business case , Chevy has apparently given up entirely. GM executive VP of product , Mark Reuss , just told Car and Driver that "" we looked at that ( the concept ) and we looked at our competitors who were doing things like that and what the market told us was that it was not a good idea. The volumes of those things were terrible. "" Too bad. The Code 130R could have become , for example , a revived Chevelle ."
69,"Chances are that the RM15 is the only Veloster you ’ d ever want to drive or own. RM stands for "" Racing Midship , "" and if that name sounds familiar it ’ s because Hyundai showed a very similar concept off in Busan last May. The mid-engine hatchback is strikingly similar to what we saw last year , albeit with the ’ 15 featuring a drastically different livery. Both pack a 2.0-liter turbo four good for 296 horsepower and 282 lb-ft of torque. That clocks in at 4.7 seconds for a 0 to 60 sprint , but the Veloster is n't designed for straight-line speed. The RM15 was designed to be light and nimble. To this end an aluminum spaceframe was paired with carbon-fiber body panels. All of this helped the RM15 drop about 200 pounds below the normal Veloster ’ s curb weight. It sits only 19 inches off of the ground and sports a front-to-rear-weight distribution of 43 : 57. Yes , the Veloster RM15 would be incredibly awesome if it came to market. Hyundai ’ s official press release featured some confusing double-talk regarding its future. The hatchback was described as "" a true concept car , not being a one-time design concept car. "" If Hyundai hopes to save the Veloster it ’ ll need to do something drastic , as in this ."
70,"Don ’ t think for a moment that Dodge was going to let Chevrolet off that easy. Now that the Corvette Z06 is on the loose , Dodge really had no choice but to offer up something equally ridiculous. And that ’ s the just revealed 2016 Viper ACR , the "" fastest street-legal Viper track car. "" So , how powerful is it ? Try 645 hp and 600 lb-ft from that 8.4-liter V10. Add to that a new aero kit with plenty of carbon fiber elements , an enhanced suspension , and specialty track tires , and we have the baddest factory-spec Viper to date. But what about that Z06 ? It pumps out 650 hp and 650 lb-ft thanks to its supercharged 6.2-liter V8. Along with its own body , suspension , braking and tire enhancements , the Z06 isn ’ t about to let the new Viper ACR walk all over it. But which of these track animals do you prefer ? Which , do you think , will ultimately prevail to be the best-handling and fastest American-built supercar around a track ? Let us know in the comments ahead ."
71,"In preparation for the car 's global debut at the IAA Frankfurt Motor Show 2015 in just a couple of weeks , two images of the hottest new AMG model have just surfaced online along with a teaser video. Snapped during an official presentation of the car , these pictures clearly show a top-spec S model wearing an aggressive body kit with the multiple aerodynamic components that we 've already seen on the sedan and wagon models. And from the looks of it , it really wants to chew up the BMW M4 for breakfast. As we already know , the C63 Coupe will be powered by Mercedes-AMG 's 4.0-liter engine and will be offered in two levels of tuning. The standard model will deliver 469 hp and 479 lb-ft of torque , while the boosted C63 S Coupe seen here will pump out 503 hp and 516 lb-ft. In terms of styling , the front end is nearly identical to the sedan and wagon models , featuring large intakes and an angry-looking bumper. The rear retains the standard coupe 's taillights but adds quad exhaust pipes , a prominent diffuser and carbon fiber spoiler. Ca n't wait for more ? We expect more news and images to surface before the car 's official debut ."
72,"Like everyone else in the world who watched “ Back to the Future Part II ” we ’ ve been keeping an eye on the Lexus Hoverboard. The automaker released a teaser video saying it would debut August 5th , although the video ’ s title said the fourth. Regardless , it ’ s the fourth and the hoverboard is here in all its glory. This video shows the board being used at a skate park just like a normal skateboard. It catches air and grinds just like the real deal. Unfortunately there are no flip tricks , so do n't expect to see any hover kick flips. Watch skateboarder Ross McGouran give the board a spin. Even though he was its tester the skater still has some trouble keeping his balance. The tech behind the board is a bit hard to explain but we ’ ll do our best. Basically it has two layers. The top one is an insulated core featuring high temperature superconducting blocks. These are in turn put inside reservoirs of liquid nitrogen that cool them all the way down to -322 Fahrenheit. Below this level sits a track of magnets. Supercooling a superconductor causes it to rise off the ground , although only slightly as the board shows. Thanks to science it looks like the hoverboard is more or less legit which makes our hearts happy. Let us know if you buy what Lexus is selling in the comments ."
73,"Mercedes-Benz ’ s AMG focuses purely on performance and we love it. It often ignores fuel economy , as seen in the biturbo V12 engines. It also glances over practicality , with wild models such as the gull-winged SLS AMG. All of this is changing soon , for better or worse. For the first time AMG will take fuel economy into serious consideration when developing new models. The catch is however , that they won ’ t be “ ready ” until 2020 , which is strange considering brands such as BMW and Ferrari have already begun working with hybrids. Mercedes-Benz head of R&D , Thomas Webber , spoke to Autocar regarding holding off on any sort of hybrid setup until 2020. He explained , “ We haven ’ t done it so far , because right now the customer wouldn ’ t buy it. AMG customers tell us they want the sportiest performance option available in any given sector of the performance market. ” Although the thought of a hybrid GT S may be worrisome , we are expecting AMG to do it right. What it will mean is a torque boost at zero RPM and even more horsepower to shrink 0-60 times. Oh , and better fuel economy. We trust AMG so much that we are hoping hybrid setups come even sooner as five years is way behind the curve ."
74,"From the moment it was unveiled in 2011 , the Ferrari FF has been somewhat controversial. Not everyone is a fan of its shooting brake three-door body style. But it does have a 6.3-liter V12 and four seats that help make it one of the best grand tourers on sale today. There ’ s nothing else quite like it , with one exception : the Pininfarina-styled Ferrari Studio CR 25. In fact , the CR 25 predated the FF by nearly four decades when it premiered at the 1974 Turin Motor Show. It was actually Pininfarina ’ s first concept car designed in its new wind tunnel. The idea was to have a large , front-engined four-seater with a minimum drag coefficient. With the use of that new wind tunnel , designers managed a low air resistance of 0.256 , hence its name. Power came courtesy of the Ferrari BB ’ s 4.9-liter flat 12. And here ’ s a batch of vintage photos showing off the CR 25. Camels must have been a thing back then ."
75,"With the 25-year ban on importing a JDM R32 Nissan Skyline GT-R to the US having now ended , there ’ s been plenty of interested buyers. Perhaps too many. Not so long ago we reported , based on one customer ’ s experience , that it ’ ll cost a reasonable $ 15,000- $ 20,000 to buy and import from Japan an R32 in good condition and with relatively low mileage ( considering its age ) . Many figured the price would have been quite a bit higher , thus creating a sudden surge in demand. According to some digging around by Road & Track , that same R32 is now costing US buyers $ 20k- $ 30k. Fortunately however , this pricing isn ’ t expected to last forever. Once the R32 hype dies down a bit in a year or two , prices will probably return to what they were several months ago. If you ’ re willing to wait a few more years , pricing will likely continue to drop even further. Why ’ s that ? The R33 and R34 import ban will be lifted in 2018 and 2024 , respectively ."
76,"The new "" Legend 2.Woah "" built by Fab Fours is a radical rock climbing punk rock 4x4 constructed with equal parts show and go. In other words , not only does the Legend 2 look crazy , it is also an incredible rock climbing performer. The Legend 2 is the next generation of the original and greatly hyped Fab Fours "" Legend "" that appeared on Jay Leno 's Garage. The latest version in the series features monstrous Baja Claw tires , extended wheelbase , doorless side panels , and a bright red spiky mohawk that hints at the Jeep 's badassness. It 's also fully equipped with an integrated grille and bumper referred to as the "" Grumper "" , which gives the 4x4 extra clearance. Power comes courtesy of a 480 hp GM crate V8. That powerful engine combined with the incredible design of this insane trail tackling Jeep make the Legend 2 absolutely worthy of its name ."
77,"Perhaps it all started with the Porsche Cayenne. When it launched back in 2002 , many believed Porsche had gone , well , kind of nuts. A Porsche SUV ? Who the hell were they kidding ? Only now it ’ s Porsche that ’ s having the last laugh ; the Cayenne ( and its second gen successor ) have brought in millions upon millions of crisp , clean cash. A loaded Cayenne Turbo S costs at least $ 160,000 , and yet its basic underpinnings are the same as that of a fully loaded $ 67,000 Volkswagen Touareg. See why competing brands want SUVs of their own ? It may have taken a few years , but we ’ ll soon have SUVs from Bentley , Rolls-Royce , Jaguar , Maserati , Lamborghini , and Lotus. Aston Martin is planning a crossover , but the idea is exactly the same. If mainstream automakers are raking in huge profits with crossovers and SUVs , then why can ’ t luxury and supercar brands do the same ? Porsche has well proven the formula works. That said , those brands are anything but mainstream. Shouldn ’ t they be solely focusing on the cars that made them what they are today ? Brand purists will likely agree , but that ’ s not how this business works. The goal of any company – automakers especially – is profit , and SUVs/CUVs bring in lots of dough ."
78,"Jeremy Clarkson used to host a show called Top Gear on the BBC. Remember that ? Although he ’ s now set to host a new show on Amazon Prime , anything Clarkson-Top Gear related is still a hot commodity , such as this 2014 Ford F-150 VelociRaptor 600. This is the very same VelociRaptor Jezza drove on the season 22 episode of Top Gear while in Vancouver. And now Hennessey Performance has put it up for sale. List price : $ 150,000. Aside from Clarkson ’ s denim-covered ass cheeks sitting in the driver ’ s seat , what makes this truck so special ? For starters , it ’ s an SVT Raptor. And then Hennessey tinkered with it some and made it into the VelociRaptor. Upgrades include a 2.9-liter supercharger system that helps increase output to 626 hp. 0-60 mph happens in just 5.2 seconds. Other features include a fuel injector upgrade , high flow air induction , air-to-water intercooler , Magnaflow CatBack exhaust , and serial numbered dash and engine plaques. There ’ s only 10,000 miles on the clock and it ’ s just sitting there waiting for someone to buy it ."
79,"Although Toyota has only confirmed that its 2014 FT-1 Concept will serve as the design basis and inspiration for the next generation of the Supra , its customers have pretty much been begging for it to stay the way it is ever since this show-stopping concept was revealed in 2014. Now , as the Toyota-BMW collaboration draws closer to completion , it 's clear that the next Supra 's toughest opponent will be its homegrown Japanese cousin , the Honda/Acura NSX. And where should this battle take place if not in the Japanese Super GT racing series ? Already ahead of the game , Javier Oquendo Design has dressed the FT-1 in a Super GT coat of arms. Beyond the obvious Castrol Edge livery , Oquendo has virtually equipped the concept with a massive rear wing , flared wheel arches , massive aftermarket wheels and a new rear diffuser that should keep it very close to the ground. Now that it is in its ninja suit , does this Super GT Supra /FT-1 look ready to take on some serious Japanese racing wars ?"
80,"The all-new Ford Mustang is currently making its way to anxious owners across the globe , but not every country has enough muscle car competition. Take Australia , for example. Now that local Holden production is ending and there are no immediate plans to bring the 2016 Chevrolet Camaro Down Under just yet , the muscle car segment is about to be owned by the Mustang , and Ford isn ’ t too happy about that , from a non-sales point of view. No , this is about enthusiast competition. Speaking to CarAdvice , Ford Australia communications chief , Wes Sherwood , stated : "" You have at the core of sports cars in general , and Mustang specifically , enthusiasts. And what do enthusiasts like to do ? They like to have a car that ’ s better than other enthusiasts...having that competitive spirit is important. "" The bottom line is that Australia is in need of another American muscle car to keep that competitive spirit going ; it ’ s a part of muscle car culture. Fortunately , just last week a Fiat Chrysler official hinted that both the Challenger and Charger are strongly being considered for Australia ."
