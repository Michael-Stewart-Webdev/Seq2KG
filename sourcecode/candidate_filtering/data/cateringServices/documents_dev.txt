Crispy Bird , which opens in Indianapolis next week , began simply. “ I just wanted to open a fried chicken shack , ” says chef David Hoover of the idea he had years ago , just as fried chicken restaurants were becoming trendy. Hoover grew up in a restaurant family — Indianapolis empire-builder Martha Hoover is his mother — but , he says , “ I realized there was so much I didn ’ t know how to do. I thought I knew how to cook , but I had never really taken the time to educate myself properly. ” Hoover attended culinary school in France , before taking some time to cook there and in Copenhagen. Now , he ’ s back in Indianapolis , and he ’ s partnering with his mom and her group to bring his vision to life. The restaurant represents only the tip of the iceberg of Patachou , Inc. , which owns and operates restaurants in the Indianapolis area , beginning with the first Cafe Patachou in 1989. In 2017 alone , Patachou embarked on an expansion of Public Greens , a salad-focused restaurant that donates proceeds to charity , opened a 16-seat bar called 114 , and , now , Crispy Bird.
Drinking wine and watching Saturday Night Live are activities that go hand in hand together. So it makes perfect sense that the creators of the longest-running sketch show on television are now releasing their own brand of booze. Three of these bottles are named after popular characters from the show : Debbie Downer South Eastern Australian Chardonnay ( $ 20 ) , Stefon Beaujolais ( $ 18 ) , and the Californians Monterey County Merlot ( $ 20 ) . Those are all great sketches to name wines after , but it ’ s a shame that the Hot Tub Love-ahs don ’ t have their own bottle ( or bota bag ) . It ’ s also slightly surprising that the Californians are associated with a Central Coast merlot and not a sparkling white , and that Stefon is helping hawk beaujolais , since he ’ s really more of a vodka and Red Bull kind of guy.
Japanese bento boxes typically contain an assortment of relatively light , healthy items like fish , vegetables , soup , and salads , along with small portions of rice , meat , or tempura. But a new lunch delivery service called Gochikuru is taking the set meal in the completely opposite direction with the release of a two-foot-wide cow-shaped box full of 10 pounds of wagyu beef from Tottori Prefecture , which is widely considered to be some of the most delectable meat in the world. The slices of cooked sirloin , prime rib , brisket , and tongue , are arranged over Kinu Musume rice , and the meal is garnished with dipping sauces , lime wedges , and wasabi. This special delivery item will set you back around $ 2,800 after sales tax. That ’ s truly a lot of money for a bento box , but if you were to split this order with nine friends , you could each feast on a pound of meat for around $ 280 — still expensive , but that price is at least in the realm of what you might spend on a splashy dinner at a steakhouse.
Lily Wen steps out of her pickup truck and walks straight into the tropical jungle of Taitung , Taiwan , rummaging through the understory to find what she needs. She spots a vine with heart-shaped , glossy , dark green leaves wrapped around the truck of the paper mulberry tree. Dangaw ( Piper betle ) is the vine ’ s name in the Rukai language. Laoye 荖 葉 is its Mandarin name. With a distinct peppery and slightly spicy aroma , dangaw is usually cooked in stews. It ’ s considered a culinary delicacy and is one of Wen ’ s favorites. She pulls up a bunch , throws it in the back of her pickup truck , and motions to the forest around her. “ I have a food map in my head of the forest , ” she says in Chinese , smiling. “ Before , we all did. ” She drives back to her restaurant and begins picking the leaves off the vine. Today , she ’ ll be making chicken soup flavored with dangaw for her customers.
Today , Michelin , the tire company that awards stars to its favorite fine dining destinations , released its 2018 guide to Hong Kong and Macau. The list includes 74 starred recommendations in Hong Kong and 18 in Macau. As in last year ’ s guide , the same eight restaurants retained three Michelin stars this year , including Eater Essential 38 restaurant Lung King Heen , which became the first restaurant from a Chinese chef to earn three stars , back in the 2009 Michelin guide. The two-star category — those restaurants that are “ worth a detour ” — is equally snoozy. The same 16 restaurants , 11 in Hong Kong and five in Macau , retained their stars. Michelin added just eight new one-star selections to the guide this year , all in Hong Kong. They include Arcane , Kaiseki Den by Saotome , Imperial Treasure , and Cantonese restaurants Ying Jee Club and Yee Tung Heen.
Like many other major cultural institutions , the restaurant industry is reckoning with an epidemic of sexual harassment and assault. Like many other reckonings , this one is long overdue. Over the past few decades , the role of chefs in America transformed from never-seen , poorly paid labor hidden away in cramped kitchens to objects of endless fascination across television , news media , books , and increasingly , film. The chefs anointed as cultural arbiters were almost always white , almost always male. They shouted. They swaggered. They got sued for sexual harassment. But when one fell , there was always another white man to take his place , and never enough discussion why. In the wake of the Times-Picayune expose about pervasive harassment within the Besh Restaurant Group in New Orleans , one that many employees say emanated from top management , longtime advocates for equality in the industry like Preeti Mistry , Jen Agg , and Amanda Cohen are speaking out about kitchens ’ long-unspoken epidemic of sexual harassment. Male food-world celebrities and chefs like Anthony Bourdain , Tom Colicchio , and Daniel Patterson have decried systemic sexism in the industry , and take ( some measure of ) responsibility.
In 2017 , if a meal consumed at a restaurant doesn ’ t get posted online , did it really happen ? Now that 95 percent of Americans own a cell phone of some kind , opportunistic restaurateurs are encouraging smartphone usage by designing venues and menus with Instagram in mind. Even if they don ’ t go viral , these photos become free marketing for a chef ’ s menu or business. Starbucks rode the Instagram trend hard this past year by releasing limited-edition , eye-popping Unicorn and Zombie-themed Frappuccinos ; in San Francisco ’ s Mission District , the Cuban restaurant Media Noche provides Instagram-ready content in the form of its floral-tiled floors. A handful of restaurant operators , however , are going in the opposite direction and actively discouraging phone use at the table. The marketing ploy here is meant to appeal to diners that remember “ the good ol ’ days ” when a shared meal was about conviviality and real-life conversation — not “ the ‘ gram. ”
How many chicken wings does $ 2.9 billion buy ? That ’ s the price roast beef sandwich-slinging fast-food brand Arby ’ s agreed to fork over to acquire casual dining chain Buffalo Wild Wings. The deal is the most recent in a recent slew of big restaurant mergers , from Burger King buying Popeyes to Panera snapping up Au Bon Pain. BWW is just the latest addition to the portfolio of Roark Capital Group , a private equity firm that controls Arby ’ s and the sandwich chain Jimmy John ’ s , as well as Carl ’ s Jr. and Hardee ’ s parent company CKE Restaurants. Acquiring a chicken wing chain would seemingly make sense for Arby ’ s in light of its now-famous “ We have the meats ” tagline , and analysts also think it wise for more practical reasons : “ 45 percent of the population orders wings at least once a year , and that ’ s up 2 points from a year ago , ” according to restaurant analyst Bonnie Riggs of market research firm NPD Group. ( Interestingly , Roark also used to own BWW competitor Wingstop , but sold off the last of its holdings in the chain in 2016. )
At first look , that little contraption with the words “ Mac & Cheese Nation ” on it looks like a cross between an electric kettle and a children ’ s toy. And so it ’ s posing a question : Is this hideous device , despite the fact that it may save you time on your next bowl of mac and cheese , worth having at home where visitors could see it ? Does it reign supreme to just a pot of boiling water ? We ’ ll start our theory with bringing water to a boil , a process that ’ s three minutes shorter when using the mac and cheese maker. There do seem to be some downsides to the maker : It ’ s plastic and a little flimsy , so longevity isn ’ t a selling point ; and the crank system is rendered useless while the pouring spout on top is being used. But if you ’ re an avid mac and cheese chef , maybe you need a little more research to decide if this is something you should actually buy.
A real-life version of a fictional fast food burger restaurant featured in Nickelodeon cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants could be in jeopardy. According to The Hollywood Reporter , Nickelodeon 's parent company , Viacom , filed a trademark infringement lawsuit this week against Houston-based IJR Capital Investments for allegedly operating a restaurant called The Krusty Krab. Known as the place where SpongeBob works as a na ï ve , devoted fry cook , The Krusty Krab seems ripe for a Bubba Gump-esque franchise. However , Viacom has yet to capitalize on this potential. Still , the company leaves open the possibility in its filing , stating that given its " extensive use of the 'Krusty Krab ' mark in a wide variety of trade channels — and the fact that the 'Krusty Krab ' is a restaurant in the SpongeBob universe — it is within the zone of natural expansion of Viacom business to operate in restaurant services. " The lawsuit further argues that IJR 's attempts to register Krusty Krab trademarks qualifies as infringement due to its " identical in appearance and sound , " which would likely lead to " confusion as to the source of the Infringing Mark and Defendant 's corresponding services. "
Scoring is totally arbitrary , of course , with the exception of these points : • 1 point for staying in the competition • 2 points for making it to the top three in a challenge • 5 points for winning a challenge • 3 points for making me cry • 50 point deduction for being eliminated There are significant moments in history that illustrate the perseverance of feminism. In 1920 the suffragettes fought hard for our right to vote. In 1972 we got the Equal Rights Amendment. In 2001 , peak Britney Spears danced with a seven-foot albino python on stage at the MTV Video Music Awards. And on January 29 , 2016 , we have our first girl winner of MasterChef Junior. I know the above paragraph may seem to devalue this momentous occasion , but I assure you , this is actually a huge deal. In four seasons of the show , this is the first time a girl will inevitably win the title. Until this point , only one girl had made it to the final round.
The Food and Drug Administration recently declared genetically modified salmon perfectly safe to eat , but the government agency is temporarily barring the fish. The FDA wo n't allow imports until it can publish guidelines on how the product can be labeled , reports the Washington Post. The FDA previously stated , " AquAdvantage salmon is as safe to eat as any non-genetically engineered ( GE ) Atlantic salmon , and also as nutritious. " But , the ban reportedly is a response to language in a spending bill passed by Congress , which forbid the sale of genetically engineered salmon until the agency finalizes rules about how it should be labeled. The Post says that process could take years. The ban should put detractors of genetically modified organisms at ease , at least for the time being. When the FDA first ruled on the salmon , Food & Water Watch issued a statement decrying AquAdvantage 's approval and noting that parent company AquaBounty has some unsavory history. " In recent years , AquaBounty facilities outside the United States have dealt with an accidental disease outbreak , an accident that lead to ‘ lost ' salmon , and a $ 9,500 fine from Panamanian regulators who found the company in breach of that country 's environmental laws , " the statement claims.
A norovirus outbreak affecting more than 390 people is linked to the New Theatre Restaurant in Overland Park , Kan. , the state 's Department of Health & Environment announced Thursday. Officials say the illnesses were first reported by people who ate at the dinner theater venue on January 17. The health department is seeking information from anyone who has eaten at the New Theatre since January 15. The Kansas City Star reports the restaurant is cooperating with the investigation , and the outbreak may be linked to a man who was showing signs of illness on January 17. Three employees are confirmed to have norovirus , and they all served the man in question. The Kansas Department of Agriculture reportedly conducted an inspection at the restaurant on January 20 , finding seven " priority violations. " Among the issues were an employee who handled a raw chicken tray with gloved hands and then handled ready-to-eat fried chicken without washing hands or changing gloves.
McDonald 's made a bold move in November when the chain revealed it was planning to add mozzarella sticks to the menu. The fast food giant began testing the new side in Wisconsin over the summer , and the fried cheese saw a nationwide launch earlier this month as part of the McPick 2 promotion. But , they are n't the best option for anyone trying to snack responsibly. What are the health-conscious supposed to do ? Behold , McDonald 's cheese-less cheese sticks. I came in with extremely low expectation for @ McDonalds mozzarella sticks.....yet somehow I was still disappointed pic.twitter.com/G7IlmQp7b5
Valentine 's Day and its gaggle of heart-shaped merchandise is just over the horizon , which means it 's also time for the onslaught of weird novelty foods. Right on cue , a small Tokyo ramen chain called Mensho will unveil chocolate ramen on February 1 , reports RocketNews24. Chocolate ramen ? Sure , we 'll try anything once ! https : //t.co/Rif7T8jsXC # JapaneseFood # ramen pic.twitter.com/w5nnpVgy8W The idea of ramen noodles with a hint of cocoa in the dough seems pretty harmless , or perhaps a broth deepened with some melted dark chocolate ( hey , it works for mole ) . But no : Instead , this soup has solid chunks of chocolate swimming around in it , as if someone dropped a broken Hershey bar into your lunch. RocketNews says that while yes , you can " simply grab pieces of chocolate with your chopsticks and eat them like you would any other ramen toppings , " the pro move is to let the candy melt into the soup and then slurp up chocolatey-coated noodles. Perhaps Mensho will bring its chocolate ramen across the vast ocean when it opens in San Francisco next month.
President Donald Trump ’ s inauguration cake continues to make headlines. First , it was revealed that Team Trump ordered a Washington , DC bakery to produce an exact replica of President Barack Obama ’ s 2013 cake , which was originally created by celebrity baker Duff Goldman.

The Daily Show with Trevor NoahGet More : The Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,The Daily Show Video Archive Noah says his team received a mysterious phone call regarding the cake , and it showed up at The Daily Show ’ s studio the next day.

The first time I talked to Oakland chef James Syhabout was on the sidewalk outside Hawker Fare. This was in 2011 , before the restaurant was even open. Five years later , Hawker Fare is closing , a casualty of the city ’ s real estate frenzy. The book I helped Syhabout write — a memoir about growing up on an Oakland block with other Lao refugee families , and the Thai restaurant his mom operated in the space that would become Hawker Fare — hasn ’ t even been published. Already it ’ s an elegy for a vanished time. That ’ s how it goes these days. A restaurant , like the story of a chef ’ s life , doesn ’ t always end where you expect it to , wrapped up with a hopeful epilogue. As cities like Oakland change , displacing families who struggle to keep their roots alive in toxic soil , restaurants , and narratives , change with them. This one started with so much life.
Do you like food ? Do you like movies ? Do you like movies about food ? If you answered yes to any of those questions , you might enjoy Eater at the Movies , a column by Joshua David Stein. There was a time when the most troubling mystery of Riverdale — home of Archie Andrews and his adolescent cohort — was what was going on with Archie ’ s hair. What did the weird crosshatching along its fiery sides signify ? A close second , of course , was Archie ’ s eternal Manichean dilemma : Would his affections fall on the forces of wholesome but dull , played by Betty , or of venal but exciting , played by Veronica ? A distant but salient third mystery that only occurred to me later : Why the fuck are Betty and Veronica , both strong independent women , interested in Archie anyway ? Dude ’ s basic. But as weighty as those issues were — and they did keep me up at night — that version of Riverdale existed in simpler times when the best part of grocery shopping was trying to convince my mother to buy the newest issue of the various permutations of the comic book tucked kid-eye-level in the checkout aisle at Genuardi ’ s.
It ’ s taken him a couple years , but acclaimed Mexico City chef Enrique Olvera is about ready to close the doors at his fine-dining sensation Pujol. In the coming weeks , he ’ ll be relocating Pujol to a stunner of a space : It ’ s minimalist but lush , clean but inviting , ultra Right This Moment but also timeless. Diners who are familiar with Olvera ’ s hit New York City restaurant Cosme will also see some familiar aesthetic choices. “ I realized with Cosme that I like restaurants that are fun , ” he told the New York Times earlier this month. “ I like restaurants that are not special-occasion restaurants , and where people can just come in and relax and have a beautiful time. ” To that end , there ’ s plenty of bar space , and the wood tables will remain tablecloth-free. Olvera is heeding the call heard by chefs around the world , and focusing almost exclusively on wood-fired cooking. With a grill and a hearth , the new Pujol kitchen is noticeably short on stovetop burners. Instead , there ’ s a comal ( a cast iron flat top for tortillas ) and outside , a brick oven for dishes like barbacoa. There ’ s also a backyard herb garden.
Monkfish might be the closest thing to a sea monster that ’ s served in fancy restaurants. In stores , monkfish are available in approachable fillets , but for this episode of Fresh Catch , Adam Geringer-Dunn of Greenpoint Fish & Lobster Co. brought in a whole one from the market and showed us how to handle it. Monkfish have huge heads , the better for ( their own ) eating. Monkfish attract prey with a small fishing rod above their mouth. When the rod lures smaller fish in close , the monkfish opens up its terrifying mouth and chomps down. The fish have two rows of very sharp teeth , and they ’ ll eat anything , including smaller monkfish. Because the head is mostly inedible ( and a little intimidating ) , it ’ s usually removed before the fish makes it to market. However , if you know where to look , there ’ s some good meat to be found on the cheeks.
