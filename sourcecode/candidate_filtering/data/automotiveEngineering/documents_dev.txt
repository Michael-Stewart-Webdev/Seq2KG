Back in the late 1990s , someone at Jaguar , then owned by Ford , had the brilliant idea ( note : full dosage of sarcasm ) to take the European Ford Mondeo sedan and turn it into an entry-level Jaguar. That became known as the X-Type , which launched in 2001. It was a clear warning sign that Jaguar was in deep shit. Build quality was decent enough but every self-respecting Jaguar fan knows a Jag is not a rebadged Ford , no matter how many design changes are made. The X-Type name , we all assumed was damned to hell forever. Only it almost wasn ’ t. Jaguar , according to its head designer Ian Callum , came close to naming its upcoming SUV the X-Type. F-Pace was the final decision , which isn ’ t at all an odd choice ( sarcasm continued ) and , believe it or not , Callum himself favored X-Type. When it came down to three names after X-Type was eliminated , Callum also voted for F-Pace. " I like it because I think it ’ s got a bit of texture and character to it and I think after time people will get used to it , " Callum explained. Whatever. At least X-Type remains dead. Hopefully forever .
Dubbed the “ Zonda i ” ( i for inspired ) , this Pagani Zonda replica was recently auctioned on eBay with the winning bid coming in at £ 7,100. Based on a 1989 Ford Scorpio ( the US had the car briefly in the late Eighties , sold as the Merkur Scorpio ) with a space frame based on the Ultima GTA , the DIY Zonda comes powered by an Audi-sourced 3.7-liter twin-turbo V8 mated to a five-speed Audi box. The UK-based seller claims that with the right mapping , the engine could put down over 500 horsepower. Combined with a curb weight of less than 900 kg , it could also clock 0-60 mph in 2.9 seconds and hit a top speed of 187 mph. But it would take a brave man to attempt that. It boasts the same dimensions as the Zonda C12 , and comes finished in black and blue with a pearlescent holographic metal flake. Other nice touches include 19-inch rims , Audi TT power mirrors , HD rear view camera , authentic Zonda rear lights , and touchscreen monitor. We ’ ve seen plenty of replicas over the years , and this is one of the better attempts. Not that the builder cares what you think , as he already found a buyer .
Mercedes has unveiled the 2016 Mercedes SL in LA this week. The face-lifted roadster received a range of styling tweaks inside and out , as well as more tech and power. Curvier headlights replace the old model ’ s angular eyes and are pulled out to the corners , full LEDs come as standard , while the grille has been flipped upside down which works well with the restyled bumper. The aggressive new face combined with an all-new hood was clearly influenced by the AMG GT and brought more in line with the latest Mercedes models. The SL400 has been upgraded to the SL450 , with its 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6 boosted to 362 hp and 369 lb-ft of torque. 0-62 mph now comes in at 4.9 seconds. The SL550 remains unchanged with the V8 continuing to deliver 449 hp and 516 lb-ft. Both ditch their seven-speeds for the new 9G-Tronic automatic. At the top of the line , the SL63 AMG with its 577-hp 5.5-liter V8 and the S65 AMG utilizing a 621-hp 6.0-liter V12 , benefit from a mechanical rear different lock , an updated seven-speed and quicker shifting via aluminum paddle-shifters .
Mazda shocked the world with the RX-Vision concept at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show. The concept had all of the right lines and looked absolutely stunning , but we were also interested in what would power the vehicle. We know that Mazda ’ s hard at work on creating a turbocharged rotary engine , but recent rumors have revealed that the new power plant will come out in 2017. Next year will be the 50th anniversary of Mazda ’ s rotary so it ’ s the perfect time to reveal the automaker ’ s new engine. We already knew that the RX-9 will feature a turbocharger , but a source close to Mazda has provided some more insight into the rotary engine. According to Australia ’ s Motoring , an unnamed source close to Mazda stated that the automaker is testing a new hybrid turbo rotary engine — “ 16X ” — that features a twin-800cc rotor set-up for approximately 450 hp. Power will more than likely go to the rear wheels through a rumored dual-clutch configuration that will be integrated into the rear axle for improved weight distribution. Apparently , Mazda engineers are working on a two-stage turbo system that will have an “ electric turbo assist ” at low rpm and a standard exhaust-driven turbo at higher rpm .
The BMW M4 GTS is one of the coolest and fastest bimmers ever. With 493 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque coming from its twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six , the GTS does 0-60 mph in 3.7 seconds and tops out at 189.5 mph. It has new wheels , an adjustable carbon fiber rear wing , a carbon fiber rear diffuser , a titanium exhaust system , a water injection system and other cool bits. All of these modifications make the GTS stand out and outperform the standard M4 and its rivals. We 've also seen the M4 GTS perform on the track with the equally stunning M2 and we were very impressed. However , what we didn ’ t know when the GTS was released earlier was the exact price. We first thought it 'd cost around $ 161,972 which would have made it the most expensive BMW ever , but it seems that wo n't be the case. The M4 GTS will officially cost $ 134,200 with a $ 995 destination fee , pretty much the same price as the i8. So , if you have around $ 140,000 to spend on a BMW , you have a choice between the eco-friendly but super cool i8 or the hardcore track-focused M4 GTS. But should the M4 GTS be worth so much more than the standard M4 , which costs around $ 70,000 ? We ’ re not so sure about that. Live shots by Alden Tatum .
As animals that reside at the top of the food chain , we no longer need to spend a lot of time hunting. The result is that we easily get bored and try the craziest things that come to our mind in order to milk excitement out of life. Luckily , video cameras let us capture and share our stunts to show the world just how far we have come. With this , we can make a highlight reel of the good , the bad , the embarrassing , and the just plain ugly of humanity. Here are the standouts from the past week. If you don ’ t know who BJ Baldwin is then you ’ re about to get pretty familiar with him thanks to another one of his Recoil videos. It ’ s like Gymkhana except with way more jumps and a jackass Sasquatch. Ahh gold diggers , what would we do without them ? This particular Ferrari owner is driving his F430 around when an attractive woman approaches him to inquire about his personality. He then informs the young lady that he is in fact a valet and does not own the vehicle , but would still like her phone number. How do you think she reacted ?
In the age of Facebook , nothing stays private. Cheating , drama , people you ’ re “ talking to , ” and even things you never wanted to know about family members all get posted. Now Alfa Romeo has had its underwear hung out to show when a page entitled “ Alfa Romeo Project 952 ” leaked the engine lineup for Alfa Romeo ’ s Guilia , an upcoming competitor to the Mercedes C-Class , Cadillac ATS , and BMW 3 Series. If the photo holds truth , then the Germans should worry about Italy ’ s entry into this market. The Guilia will have three engine types with varying output. The 2.0-liter four-banger will get 200 hp , 250 hp , and 280 horsepower depending on the spec. The 2.2-liter four-cylinder will start at 150 horses , move up to 180 horsepower , and cap off at 210 ponies. The most exciting engine is said to be “ inspired by Ferrari ” and will be a 2.9-liter turbocharged V6 with rear wheel drive , an optional double clutch transmission or manual , and either 490 to 500 horsepower. All models will be rear-wheel drive except the 250 horsepower and 280 horsepower 2.0 liters as well as the 2.2-liter 210 horsepower version. All we can say is that we are excited to see how some Italian pizzazz fits into this crowded but popular segment .
Automotive design company Kahn Design has a reputation for taking some of the world ’ s most incredible high-end vehicles and customizing them with state-of-the-art design techniques. One of the most popular vehicles that Kahn is known for is its spectacular heavily modified version of Land Rover ’ s Defender dubbed the “ Flying Huntsman ” 6x6. The Huntsman , along with several other vehicles owned by the design company , are often prominently displayed at the Kahn Design show room on Kirkstall Road in Leeds , England. One of the most expensive vehicles recently put on display in the shop ’ s window is one of two Bugatti Veyrons owned by Afzal Kahn , the company ’ s founder. Unfortunately for Mr. Kahn , jealous vandals broke into the showroom this week and destroyed the windshield on the $ 1.5 million hypercar. Details are currently lacking regarding the identity of the culprits , but we hope that they are swiftly brought to justice for this senseless crime .
It ’ s pretty incredible to think about. The Nissan Skyline GT-R R32 just nailed it from the get-go. Styling , engineering , performance ; it had it all. Its R33 successor had big shoes to fill and it did so remarkably well. Both cars participated in motorsport and became legends on the track. So in only nine years ’ time , Nissan produced both the R32 and R33 , successfully raced them , and created a cult-like following of sports car enthusiast that ’ s still very much in existence today. Not bad at all considering neither one was exported stateside and found success predominately in Japan , parts of Europe , and Australia. As we learned over the course of the past few days , Nissan essentially evolved the Skyline GT-R very methodically , if not fairly conservatively ; the differences , at least in exterior styling , weren ’ t dramatically different .
Bugatti ’ s hard at work on creating a suitable successor to its Veyron and Bugatti ’ s CEO Wolfgang Durheimer believes that the automaker ’ s next hypercar will be good — really , really good. In a recent interview with Top Gear , Durheimer revealed some aspects of the vehicle and some concerns as well. “ Everything is better , ” stated Durheimer. “ More power , higher top speed. Shorter acceleration. Cleaner design. More luxury. More of everything. ” Bugatti isn ’ t just planning a proper successor , it ’ s aiming to build the best supercar in the world. “ It will be the best super-sports car on the planet , ” stated Durheimer. The Veyron was , and still is , one of the fastest cars in the world , but one individual is giving the automaker a hard time for top speed supremacy. “ One guy is giving us a hard time , ” said Durheimer. “ This Mr. Hennessey from Texas. ” It ’ s mind-boggling to know that Bugatti is feeling the pressure from the Hennessey Venom GT. Top Gear pointed out that the Veyron was a luxurious car that could go extremely fast , while the Venom GT is a one-trick pony that can only go fast. “ I believe in the Olympic games , the 100m sprint , ” stated Durhemier. “ You need to win the numbers. And we need guys like [ Hennessey ] to make the subject interesting. ”
Scion has officially debuted its all new C-HR concept at the 2015 LA Auto Show. The Scion concept will likely look familiar due to the fact that Toyota debuted a five-door version of the same concept earlier this year at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The C-HR concept is a quirky Juke-fighting hybrid crossover vehicle that sports spectacular diamond-inspired exterior styling. The futuristic looking vehicle features Toyota New Global Architecture ( TNGA ) , which strengthens the rigidity of the chassis and enhances the overall drivability. Toyota has officially confirmed that a production version of the C-HR will appear at the upcoming Geneva International Motor Show in March and will eventually hit the US market as a Scion. Hiro Koba , the C-HR chief engineer has described the vehicle as a “ fantastic urban driving car ” and Scion ’ s VP Andrew Gilleland expressed confidence that “ its styling will lead the way , but its substance will seal the deal. ”
It debuted in concept firm back in 2012 , and this week the production model took center stage at the LA Auto Show. And just to remind us that the all-weather Range Rover Evoque Convertible is a pretty little thing , James Bond ’ s secretary stripped down to her bikini for a photoshoot with the droptop SUV. We also have some live shots of the car from the show , but those featuring the gorgeous Naomie Harris are a lot easier on the eye. The US-spec model will come equipped with the familiar 2.0-liter turbocharged four banger rated at 240 hp and 251 lb-ft of torque. A nine-speed automatic transmission is also standard and all-wheel-drive is optional. The cabin can be decked out with optional features such as a 10.2-inch touchscreen with a new infotainment system and a 12-speaker 660-watt Meridian sound system. Android Auto and Apply CarPlay are both standard. Sales will begin in the middle of next year with a starting price of $ 50,475 .
When it comes to options , we usually only focus on the most ostentatious ones. That means anything offered by Ferrari — including leather-wrapped fire extinguishers and carbon fiber cup holders — makes the cut. Of course only a fraction of the industry is dominated by supercars , and every automaker offers options , even on the lowliest of rides. So , what extra feature are Americans most willing to pay for ? According to a study from AT&T and Ericsson , WiFi hotspot availability came in at No. 1. Americans really can ’ t live without their Internet. AT&T has a big stake in making in-car Internet a thing , so take these results with a grain of salt. Also , a WiFi hotspot doesn ’ t turn your car into a laptop. While device connected to the hotspot can be use the Internet fully , the car itself only accesses the Internet via pre-approved apps. That means setting your fantasy football lineup in traffic is out but streaming music is a-go. Fully autonomous cars are the next big thing but they 're still years away. The next big immediate thing is connected cars. Don ’ t be shocked if one day “ Netflix and chill ” moves from the couch to the backseat or if your car sends you push notifications while you ’ re driving it. Also , we know these are photos of supercars and not cup holders or fire extinguishers. Sue us .
A few weeks ago we spotted what ’ s clearly a hardcore version of the Pagani Huayra. It ’ s about damn time. We ’ ve reached out to our sources at Pagani for some indication as to its specs , name , etc. We ’ ll let you know once an answer arrives. But until then , that very same hardcore Huayra has been caught once again testing , only this time it ’ s getting its tires dirty at the track. It ’ s impossible to miss that large carbon fiber rear wing and rear diffuser. Best of all ? It sounds absolutely sick. We ’ re guessing that can be the work of a modified twin-turbo V12 and a different exhaust system. Rumor has it this Huayra will deliver more than 800 hp. We also know a Huayra roadster is on the way very soon , and it could be entirely possible both that and the hardcore coupe version will arrive this March at Geneva. Enjoy the music for now .
Tesla 's Gigafactory , located in the middle of nowhere in the Nevada desert , attracted some unwanted attention from two reporters recently. According to a Tesla blog post , on October 6th two Reno Gazette Journal ( RDJ ) journalists trespassed into and took pictures of the factory by climbing over a fence marked with a “ Private Property " sign. A Tesla employee asked the two for their names , notifying them that they were trespassing. They declined to give their names but had " RGJ " ID badges and the Jeep they arrived in also had RDJ decals. A second employee arrived on an ATV and asked the pair to stay as security and the sheriff 's department were en route. However , the two journalists decided to ignore the request and walked back to their Jeep. One Tesla employee tried to take down the license plate number and was rear-ended him , suffering an injured hip and cut arm. The driver then hit the ATV the second employee arrived on before striking him in the waist with the Jeep. When the sheriff arrived one journalist , identified as Andy Barron and pictured below , was arrested. He was charged with two counts of felony assault with a deadly weapon ( he was driving ) and both were charged with trespassing .
GM can ’ t go more than a few months without being in the spotlight for its engineering mishaps. This time 19 owners of C6 Corvettes have filed 20 claims against GM for fraud , negligence , and unjust enrichment because of excessive valve guide wear that causes their engines to fail. The cars affected include the 427 and Z06 models of the C6 Corvette. The suit doesn ’ t even include the current generation Corvette Z06 , which has seen exceedingly high amounts of engine failures with some engines failing with only six miles on the clock. The lawsuit claims that GM was aware of the issue but did not lift a finger to fix it because it would have cost them too much. This is not the first time GM has followed the same cut-corner philosophy to save some cash. GM has delivered a low-blow response to its customers by claiming that they were using bad gas and not following proper break-in procedures. But with both generations of Corvette facing similar issues , it ca n't just be a coincidence that all Corvette owners are terrible at maintaining their cars and filling them with the proper fuel. Hopefully this lawsuit will inspire owners of the current Corvette Z06 to go after GM for their self-sabotaging engines .
Carmakers love to have some fun around this time of year , as they get to utilize the SEMA show to showcase how various aftermarket treatments can be used to transform their stock vehicles. No less than 7 Ford F-150s will be at the Las Vegas show this year , and the Blue Oval has provided some pictures and info ahead of the trucks ’ unveiling. Each truck has a ton of mods done to them , and here 's a brief overview of each to whet your appetite. Arguably the pick of the bunch , the Forgiato F-150 comes with an Air Design USA full body kit , a slick red and black paint job , Fab Four premium bumpers , a set of 24-inch Forgiato Terra wheels , a rancho six-inch lift kit , custom lights and a Whipple supercharger. The Leer Edition Outdoorsman F-150 is finished in gloss blue with matte black accents inside and out. The truck ’ s “ live larger ” theme sees power enhancing mods , an upgraded chassis , including a 3-inch stainless steel system with 4-inch tips , a 6-inch lift suspension , 22-inch Fuel Off-road wheels and tires , six blue LED lights , and a plush leather interior with a Rockford Fosgate 1,000-Watt sound system .
No , “ Hamann Macan ” are not the first words of a voodoo chant. It 's tuning house Hamann ’ s newest iteration of Porsche ’ s smallest and cheapest SUV , the Macan. The Macan , originally intended for suburban shopping center parking lots , actually looks like a very sporty SUV. But the designers at Hamann did not agree. Aside from tuning the engine to deliver 310 horsepower and an ungodly 500 lb-ft of torque , the Macan gets a wide body kit tacked on as well as a new front fascia , grille , rear diffuser , rooftop and bootlid spoilers , and 22-inch wheels. A custom stainless steel exhaust combined with a 0-60 mph time of 5.7 seconds ensures that the people you cut off in traffic can eat your dust in admiration. The Macan itself has technology from the Porsche 911 , which probably lends to the fact that a Macan with the Hamann body kit looks a bit like a track-ready Volkswagen Beetle. The fully loaded Hamann Macan will cost buyers an additional $ 30,275 over the $ 52,000 base price of a Macan , but you cant really put a price on cool now can you ?
Cadillac is celebrating just how far it has come in the last few years by releasing special “ Crystal White Frost ” editions of the CTS-V sedan and the ATS-V sedan and coupe. In addition to the crystal white frost paint , the ATS-V gets 18 " aluminum wheels and a carbon-fiber package that adds a front splitter , hood vent , rear diffuser , and an extra aerodynamic rear spoiler. A luxury package spoils the buyer with sport alloy pedals , HID headlamps , a universal remote , enhanced CUE system with Apple CarPlay , and rear folding seats. The CTS-V gets 19 ” aluminum wheels and the same carbon fiber goodies as the ATS-V. The luxury package features a tri-zone climate system , a power rear window sunshade and manually-operated rear side window shades , heated rear outboard seating positions , and a split folding rear seat with an armrest. The ATS-V variants will start at $ 10,995 extra over the base price ( $ 60,465 for the sedan and $ 62,665 for the coupe ) to total $ 71,640 for the sedan and $ 73,660 for the coupe. The Crystal White Frost CTS-V will have the same $ 10,995 premium over the $ 83,995 base sedan , which brings the total to an eye-watering $ 94,990 .
The Ferrari LaFerrari is an immense vehicle in every sense. The exquisite design of the hypercar combined with its sheer power and stunning performance capability truly puts the LaFerrari in a class of its own. To date , the LaFerrari is the most innovative and advanced vehicle that the Italian supercar maker has ever produced. The car is powered by a set of dual electric motors mated with a 6.3 liter V12 that produces a massive 950 hp and 664 lb-ft of torque. One of the most impressive things about the LaFerrari is its ability to seamlessly handle such an incredible amount of power. The footage in this video attests to the hypercar ’ s incredible capability as a LaFerrari driver executes a perfect little powerslide , and some mean accelerations , at Ring Boulevard during the arrival of Rallye Germania .
Honda just announced it has big , big plans for SEMA 2015. Yeah , there will be Civics and HR-Vs there but what caught our eye is the Ridgeline Desert Race Truck , a concept said to give a glimpse at the 2017 Ridgeline and announce Honda ’ s return to factory off-road racing. Those are two pretty big bombshells to drop. The folks over at Honda Performance Development ( HPD ) will be behind the concept Ridgeline , which gives us hope that it will be more than just a Honda Pilot with a bed. While we were never big fans of the Ridgeline we are excited to see what the 2017 model could look like. The fact that this concept is racing inspired gives us hope that the production version will also have an HPD variant available. Doing something as bonkers as the Ford Raptor may be out of the question but what about models like the Toyota Tacoma TRD Sport or the Nissan Frontier Desert Runner ? Honda seems to be moving in the direction of “ fun ” as of recently which is a welcome change. The Civic Type R is headed to the United States soon and the new Civic both looks good and packs a turbo ! We ’ re glad there ’ s renewed focus on the Ridgeline but please , Honda , try a bit harder this time .
SEMA 2015 is coming soon , and that means teasers. Chevrolet has its “ Red Line ” cars , there 's a new Hyundai SUV from Bisimoto , and also the Florida-made and very nice-looking ER W70. Mopar didn ’ t want to get left behind so it decided to tease us by showing four of the twenty cars that it will unveil at SEMA next month in Las Vegas. The first is a Chrysler 300. Even though it looks untouched , there are new LED lights for the bottom grille , a slightly tweaked front fascia that gives the car an angry look and what appears to be a matte or satin blue paint job. The next car is a Fiat 500X and we think it ’ s going to look all right. From the teaser shot it has nice blue paint accents which seem to be reflective against the sun. It also has a parasail ! The third car is a Ram 1500 Rebel with a flashy orange paint job. It also has new wheels with red accents , extra vents and off-road tires. The last car is a Dodge Challenger and straight away it looks menacing. The teaser photo includes the Challenger with what looks like a body kit , aerodynamic parts like the trunk spoiler , a GT badge and that super cool orange paint scheme. We can ’ t wait to see what these cars will look like at the 15,345 square-foot exhibit for Mopar at SEMA .
Dropping the first official image of the upcoming Mercedes-AMG GT3 ahead of its debut in Geneva next month , the German carmaker revealed the new GT3 model based on the AMG-GT will inspire a hardcore road-legal variant that will take aim at the likes of the Porsche 911 GT3. Speaking with Autocar , AMG boss Tobias Moers said : “ A street-legal version of our GT3 racing car – that sounds like a pretty good idea. ” We couldn ’ t agree more. However , Moers revealed it wouldn ’ t carry the “ GT3 ” label nor be called a Black Series , admitting “ We will find another name for our car. ” The Mercedes-AMG GT3 will be ready for the 2016 GT3 racing season , replacing the SLS GT3. A road car will likely arrive around the same time. When it does , expect to find it lighter – thanks to the liberal application of carbon fiber – more powerful , and with better aerodynamics , brakes and suspension. Expect around a ten percent increase on the 503-hp generated by AMG-GT S. Toers conceded the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 is “ currently very understressed ” so extracting more power won ’ t be a problem. A full reveal of the Mercedes-AMG GT3 is coming soon. We can then talk more about the road car .
Small crossovers are hot right now. In case you haven ’ t noticed , automakers left and right are rushing to build their own. Premium small crossovers are especially profitable for these brands , and now Infiniti is joining the club. Presenting the QX30 Concept , which will be making its world debut at Geneva in a couple of weeks. Only a single rear three-quarters image of the concept has been revealed so far , but Infiniti has released a number of details. It ’ s basically an update of the Q30 Concept shown at Frankfurt back in 2013 , only now it ’ s been given new styling inside and out. The exterior lines in particular look very nice and streamlined. Compared to the previous concept , ride height has been boosted by 1.2 inches but the overall dimensions don ’ t seem to appear all that different. The 21-inch wheels look quite sporty. Also not pictured is the new glass roof feature. We ’ ll have complete details in the very near future .
Ferrari never did build many units of the SA Aperta. In fact , production was limited to a scant 80 units , so being able to find one for sale at all is a major accomplishment. But the SA Aperta you see here also has the distinction of being tuned by Novitec Rosso. Based off the 599 , the SA Aperta left the factory with 661 horsepower. But Novitec has strapped a couple of superchargers to the 6.0-liter V12 and bumped the power rating up to 888 horsepower. That 's actually all we know about what modifications this SA Aperta might have gotten , although that is a pretty important one. The livery is heritage-inspired and was first seen on the original 250 GTO Tour de France car. This particular car is practically new as well , with just 2,300 miles on the odometer. The asking price is set at 895,000 Euros , or a bit over a million dollars. It is evidently in France , although not much further information was offered .
This isn ’ t the first time we ’ ve seen a droptop Lexus LFA of course. The first example was revealed at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show , and a one-off LFA Spyder also exists. You can check out Jay Leno driving it around the Fuji Speedway here. The carmaker has previously made it clear there are no plans to roll this out as a production model , yet at the Media Ambition Tokyo in Roppongi Hills , a yellow example is now on display. The aim of the exhibit is to showcase “ advanced technology art ” and the Lexus convertible comes with a video & sound installation called “ 1,220 , ” which could be a reference to the LFA ’ s 1,220 mm height. Visitors to the show will be able to sit in the car while the massive screen above it displays a range of locations , enabling those behind the wheel to enjoy the sensation of driving the supercar .
First things first : This article in no way , shape or form condones DUIs. Drunk drivers are a danger to society and should be treated accordingly. That being said , we like to have fun around here and some stories are too good not to be told. Today ’ s CarBuzz Real or Fake asks you to pick the dud DUI. This isn ’ t like the time your buddy rolled a stop sign and was popped for drinking “ two beers ” on an empty stomach. No , these stories involve everything from hungry squirrels to privileged politicians. Remember , one of these tales isn ’ t true , so leave your best guess in the comment section. It ’ s not the best idea to shop for a car while drunk. It ’ s an even worse idea to take one for a test drive after having beer for breakfast. Jeff Stevens of Little Rock , Arkansas , learned this the hard way when he was popped for a DUI while test driving an F-150. Everyone knows car salesmen will do anything to close a deal , but this is a little too much .
It really all began back in 1973 when Ferrari introduced its first-ever V8 production model : the 308 GT4. But it wasn ’ t until 1976 that its Dino badge was swapped out in favor of the Ferrari " Prancing Horse. " It looked different from most other Ferraris due to it being designed by Marcello Gandini at Bertone , the man behind the wedge-shaped Lamborghini Countach. Pininfarina once again applied its curvy signature styling to the 308 GT4 ’ s successor , the 308 GTB and GTS. The Mondial was related to the 308 but it wasn ’ t considered a true high-performance model like the former. In 1985 the 328 was introduced , looking similar but an overall improvement over its predecessor. The 348 came next in 1989 followed by the F355 in 1994 , which saw the first use of a Ferrari F1 electrohydraulic manual gearbox. The next major redesign happened in 1999 with the launch of the 360 Modena. The F430 followed in 2004 , being more of a heavily refreshed 360 than a completely new model. But it was in 2009 when perhaps the biggest mid-engine V8 revolution happened in Ferrari 's history : the 458 Italia. And now its successor is here , the twin-turbo 488 GTB .
Officially , the Infiniti QX30 is a crossover version of the Q30 sedan , which sounds simple enough. But the truth is even less complicated , in that it is largely a copy of the Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class crossover. It was called a joint project , but Mercedes was in charge of pretty much all of it , with Inifiniti 's input limited to giving desired parameters for things like ride comfort. Nonetheless , Inifiniti has decided to tease the QX30 in a solitary photo of its rear end. Not that all of this Mercedes involvement is necessarily a bad thing though. People like the GLA-Class well enough , and the new Infiniti will give those who do n't care for the German styling another option. That will actually carry over to the interior as well , as the Infiniti will have a cabin that falls in line with the brand 's signature styling and comfort norms. The car will also be powered by a Mercedes-sourced 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline or similarly Teutonic 2.1-liter diesel mill. So we 're looking forward to seeing what the whole thing looks like in March , since we already know everything else about it .
Chrysler today is a very different company than it was just a few years ago , specifically before Fiat came into the picture. And the Italian automaker ’ s influence is spreading even further with a new rumor claiming that Fiat Chrysler is secretly working on a new 2.2-liter turbo diesel engine. Here ’ s the back story : A user on the Allpar website managed to dig up some info on the automaker ’ s secure dealer website , called DealerConnect. This site basically allows Fiat Chrysler dealers to find information about everything from ordering to service bulletins , recalls , etc. What this user found is that the 200 sedan is listed as having a 2.2-liter , 16-valve " DeTomaso " engine. Until now , this engine didn ’ t exist in the automaker ’ s lineup. At the same time , Alfa Romeo ( another FCA brand ) has also been working on a 2.2-liter common rail turbo diesel that ’ ll achieve an output of between 135 and 210 hp. Point being is that it appears Alfa ’ s new turbo oil burner will likely be shared with other models under the FCA umbrella , and the 200 sedan could be the first recipient .
Not every single Rolls-Royce is the epitome of good taste and sophistication. By the very nature of the Bespoke program , customers with more money than taste can turn the vehicles into some truly hideous things , although thankfully this is fairly rare. Even more rare is for Rolls to bring out something that leaves you wondering why , but here is the Phantom Drophead Coupe Nighthawk edition. It 's been around for a couple of months , but has just reached America. The exterior is painted in Diamond Black , except for the hood , which has a matte finish. Not too far out there yet , but then we get to the interior , which is absolutely covered in carbon fiber. This is accompanied by Hotspur Red accents for a look which would be fine in a supercar but looks very out of place here. It 's unsurprisingly quite similar to the look of the BMW M5 Nighthawk which Rolls-Royce 's parent company made for the Japanese market last year. But that was more subtle and also not a Rolls. With this Drophead coming in at $ 569,600 , would you say that it 's worth it ?
Previewed back in November , this one-off Pagani Huayra , dubbed the 730 S Edition , was commissioned by Alejandro Salomon who now has the million-dollar ride parked at home. The day of collection was obviously a little bit special , so for prosperity he put together a short video. To make the feeling of stepping into one of the most spectacular cars on the planet even more overwhelming , Salomon drove to the dealer in his Smart ForTwo. The contrast between the two cars couldn ’ t be greater. The Huayra 730 S boasts a fully-exposed carbon-fiber body , with blue-tinted windows , golden Zonda wheels , Zonda R lines at the bottom and Tricolore line on the top , while the Italian flag features on the brake calipers and mirrors. Given its name , we assume the AMG-sourced 6.0-liter twin-turbo V12 has been modified to deliver 730 hp , up from the stock 700 horses. After picking up his new ride , the 730 S was revealed to the public at Supercar Sunday .
Italian automaker Pagani knows how to build really fast cars. Look at the Zonda R ; that track-only monster set a Nurburgring lap time record of 6 : 47.48 thanks to its 750-hp 6.0-liter V12 engine. Once you combine that power with a very light carbon fiber body , extreme aerodynamics and stripped interior , you end up with a car that drives like a bullet. And this record was set years ago. Now there is a rumor that record has been broken by the Zonda Revolucion. Launched back in 2013 , the Revolucion is an extreme version of the already nutty Zonda R. According to Instagram user lamborghiniks ( real name Kris Singh ) , the Revolucion lapped the Green Hell in 6 : 30. That is ridiculous. How could it manage such a time ? The Revolucion weighs only 2,359 lbs ( same as the R ) and has 800 hp , resulting in nothing but ridiculous speed. The $ 2.36 million dollar hypercar also has a six-speed magnesium reversal and sequential gearbox that shifts gears in 20 milliseconds and a drag reduction system ( DRS ) found on Formula 1 cars. The funny thing is that Pagani did n't report anything about doing an official Nurburgring lap time with the Revolucion. So is this guy just making this time up ? Or is the Revolucion actually the fastest non-streel-legal car to lap the Green Hell ?
The SEMA show is always a stunning event to go to ; amazing rides , a ton of beautiful women , raffles and a bunch of other cool stuff. Speaking of raffles , there was one where the prize was a one-off Ford Focus RS customized by no one other than hooning specialist Ken Block. Each raffle ticket was only $ 10 and all ticket earnings were given to the Junior Diabetes Research Foundation International ( JDRF ) . So besides getting a Ford Focus RS for around the same cost as a pricey cocktail , what else did the lucky winner get ? The custom work from Block includes an ST Suspensions coilover kit , a set of white Fifteen52 Turbomac wheels and a Hoonigan decal on the front bumper. The interior of the hot hatch received the hoonigan blessing with embroidered logos on the rear seats. How cool is that ! ? The engine was left untouched which is perfectly fine considering that the hot hatch produces 350 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque from its 2.3-liter Ecoboost engine. According to AutoGuide , the winner is an AutoGuide forum user and he has a deep passion for all-wheel drive performance. This makes perfect sense because he owned a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and now owns ( now more like owned ) a Subaru WRX STi. Now that is a way to end a trip to the SEMA .
The Scion FR-S and Subaru BRZ are some of the greatest sports car on the market today , but enthusiasts have been begging the automakers for one simple thing : more power. After years of waiting for a faster model , it looks like Toyota has heard the cries and is planning a hardcore version of the sports car. According to a report by AutoGuide , Toyota has filed a patent that hints at an upcoming Subaru STI Performance Concept. The patent was filed in Japan and was approved earlier this month with Subaru as the creator. While the patent won ’ t get your blood flowing , the drawings of the upcoming concept sure will. Interestingly , the drawings are an exact replica of the Subaru STI Performance Concept that we saw earlier this year at the New York Motor Show. The concept sported various cosmetic changes over the stock model , but the thing that we really fell in love with was the increased performance , which was at a claimed 450 hp. Since the STI Performance Concept featured a variety of performance components from Subaru , there ’ s no word on whether Toyota would build a performance variant of the FR-S using the same parts. We don ’ t want to get too excited , but it looks like a faster BRZ may actually be in the works .
When Henry Ford promised to produce cars any regular Joe could afford , car theft sky rocketed. The mass production of vehicles and their availability in the US made them easy prey. But , this mass production not only made car theft a possibility. Once cars were in abundance - crime took another turn as cars became a means of fast escape from crime scenes. The most famous of these new fast crime criminals was none other than John Dillinger. After a few years as a failed mechanic , Dillinger finally lost his job ( like so many others in the Great Depression ) . So he decided to turn to a different business : the bank robbing business. During his one year of operation ( 1933-1934 ) , he and his gang terrorized the entire south west : murdering ten people , robbing hundreds of thousands of dollars and peforming four daring prison escapes. In March 1934 , America 's " most wanted man " , John Dillinger , escaped jail for the fourth and last time with a gun he carved from wood and the sheriff 's new Ford V8. He was so impressed with the new model that he sent a thank-you letter to Henry Ford for producing such a reliable car to out-run the cops with .
We hope everyone is enjoying their holiday weekend and everything that goes with it , but take a moment and put down your eggnog for some awesome Jeep news. According to Allpar , a Fiat Chrysler source has confirmed that Jeep has given the production green light for two new models. What are they ? The Grand Wagoneer and the Trackhawk. Both of these names were trademarked some time ago , but that doesn ’ t necessarily mean production was guaranteed. The Grand Wagoneer , more than likely , will be a new SUV slotted above the Grand Cherokee. Think of it as a three-row Dodge Durango with a Grand Cherokee suspension with its own unique body. As for the Trailhawk ? The formula is quite simple , really : that supercharged 6.2-liter Hellcat V8 with 707 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque stuffed under the Grand Cherokee ’ s hood. Bonkers , right ? Totally. We ’ ll hopefully learn more details in just a few weeks ’ time at the 2016 Detroit Auto Show .
When Snoop Dogg gives your supercar rally a shout out and drops a freestyle it ’ s safe to say you ’ ve done something right. Well judging by the amount of high-dollar rides in the seventh edition of the GoldRush Rally , a shout out from the Doggfather himself is well-warranted. The videographers over at Format67 created a highly stylized documentary series showcasing the insanity that is the annual GoldRush Rally. Seeing a Pagani Huayra and Saleen S7 liveried in rally guise is a spectacle on its own. Throw in four Veyrons to the mix and a 918 and , well , you get the idea. This is episode one of six , covering a journey beginning in San Diego and ending in Miami. Episode one provides an overview of the participating cars and teams and gives a behind the scenes look at how difficult organizing such a rally can be. Camaraderie abounds , and a bond between the viewer and onscreen persona develops. Of course the real stars here are the cars , and there is no shortage of rarefied vehicles that hew to everyone ’ s taste .
As we stated in our prior ‘ Cadillac Escalade Evolution ’ piece , the current car is a pretty well-rounded piece of kit. However , us here at CarBuzz reckon that Cadillac missed out on one big trick with the Escalade : it didn ’ t make a high-performance ‘ V ’ version. It seems like a fairly big thing to overlook. Most of the other luxury SUV brands do sporty models of their huge 4x4s , and we ’ re certain the talented team that tuned and engineered the top-draw ATS-V and CTS-V would revel in the opportunity to turn a three-ton truck into a performance car. For this moment in time , sadly , we won ’ t get the chance to see what a sportier Cadillac Escalade will look like. There ’ s been no official word from Cadillac on whether or not an ‘ Escalade V ’ will be put into production , and the only shred of evidence we have is an oh-so-short tweet from Motor Trend ’ s Jonny Lieberman that simply goes “ Cadillac Escalade V ? Believe it ” . Thankfully , there is a way to make a more performance-orientated Cadillac Escalade : simply pick one up that ’ s been fettled by the Texan supercharger charmers at Hennessey Performance Engineering. As expected from a firm that will endow the 1,200 hp Venom GT with an extra 250 hp next year , Hennessey ’ s main fettling work is around the engine .
To welcome in the Holidays , Jaguar has just created one of the greatest sleighs for Santa. While Saint Nick is known for using reindeers , Jaguar decided to create the F-Sleigh , which is closely based off the Jaguar F-Type Roadster. The British automaker fitted the F-Sleigh with skates , antlers and a trunk-mounted jet engine. Jaguar unveiled the marketing exercise at the London Edition hotel this week. The “ design study ” will promote the launch of Jaguar and Land Rover ’ s high-end merchandise collections. According to Lindsay Weaver , Director of JLR ’ s branded and licensed goods , the F-Sleigh is a way to show the world that the automakers are creating world-class vehicles. “ [ The F-Sleigh ] proves that Jaguar Land Rover is now creating much more than world-class cars , ” stated Weaver. “ We have been working tirelessly to develop collections that tell stories and celebrate our great brands , and this 2016 collection is our most desirable ever. ” Some of the items that Jaguar sells include a $ 900 Jaguar-branded leather jacket , $ 9,700 1 : 8 scale model and $ 142 leather iPad case. While items from the automaker doesn ’ t sound like a good idea , a magical sleigh based of the F-Type is amazing .
Ask yourself , what sounds better than a proper unbalanced V8 ? If you thought of anything other than " nothing , " you are wrong. The ingredients for a cocktail of bliss known as the F355 Berlinetta are the following : 375 horsepower , a 3.5-liter V8 and a Ferrari badge. As if that was n't enough , this particular Berlinetta says F1 on the back. Unfortunately that does n't mean the car can turn at six-plus Gs at over 150 mph , but it does mean that this particular model of F355 is special in a different way , specifically with its transmission. Weaving in and out of slight bends rather than wrestling through chicanes , this autocross setup drives more or less like a slalom. However this takes nothing away from the ferocious V8 as it reaches speeds close to 60 mph in what can be called , for all intents and purposes , a parking lot .
A few weeks ago we learned Porsche approved the Mission E for production , its all-electrical sedan rival to the Tesla Model S. With a driving range of some 300 miles and a supposed output of 600 hp thanks to its four electric motors , the Mission E , at least on paper , could become the most formidable EV on the market by 2020. And the Porsche workers who ’ ll be building it are extremely excited to make it happen. Germans are like that sometimes. They ca n't help it. In fact they ’ re so excited that , according to a report from Automotive News , they ’ ve " agreed to concessions worth several hundred million euros " in order to secure production. Basically , 13,000 workers at Porsche ’ s plant in Zuffenhausen agreed to concessions to get the job done. What exactly have they willingly given up ? For starters , their work week will increase from 34 to ( gasp ! ) 35 hours. Absolutely horrible , right ? But then there ’ s this : they ’ ve also agreed to drop parts of a pay increase between 2016 and 2025. Essentially work more , get paid less. That ’ s how much they believe in the future of Porsche and the Mission E specifically .
Honda has just officially revealed its new 2016 Civic Type R here at the Geneva Motor Show. And during the live debut we were given a precise clue as to how awesome this new hot hatch is going to be. So we ’ ll just get straight to it : Honda stated that the Civic Type R has set a new Nurburgring record time of 7 : 50.63 , overtaking the previous record holder , the Renault Megane RS 275 Trophy-R ’ s time of 7 : 54. Bottom line : the 2016 Civic Type R is the fastest front-wheel-drive car around in the ‘ Ring. The price ? “ In the mid 30,000 Euro range. ” Honda also proudly pointed out that , combined with , once again , providing engines to McLaren for Formula 1 , the previous debut of the new Acura NSX , and now the Type R ’ s new ‘ Ring record , the Japanese automaker is firmly back in the business of motorsport and high performance .
Upgrading its traditional English sports car appeal to take on the finest of current competitors , Morgan has just revealed this nearly-new , updated Aero 8 at the Geneva Motor Show. Replacing the Aero SuperSports and Aero Coupe , the Aero 8 is the car 's fifth generation , and despite looking alarmingly familiar , it actually boasts endless upgrades to the existing models ' offerings. The aluminum-based Aero has a stiff chassis and revamped suspension , with a new front set-up and a rear axle that incorporates a BMW limited-slip differential. Also from BMW , the 4.8-liter V8 now produces 367 horsepower. This is mated to choice of six speed automatic or paddle-shifting manual. The car 's engine has been fitted with new software , while the cabin receives a new a/c system , carbon seats and even a touchscreen multimedia system. The car will continue to be hand built , and will offer a detachable hard top as an option ( in addition to the standard folding soft top ) . It will be produced in limited numbers totaling around 300 units , though the company has not yet released official information on pricing. It will go on sale in October of this year .
Just a short while after Lamborghini revealed its Aventador LP 750-4 Superveloce , one of the company 's most passionate tuners , Mansory , has stolen the show with a fresh take on the automaker 's newest model , the Huracan. With 1000 horsepower underhood , the Mansory Torofeo Lamborghini Huracan adds a newly designed carbon-fiber kit that wraps the car from front to end , including a massive diffuser , new rear wing , front apron , side skirts , mirror housings and wheel arches. However , the most enticing change is under the hood , where two new turbocharges are joined a new fuel system , water-cooled intercooler , new camshafts , connecting rods , bearings and pistons. These components push the original 5.2-liter V10 to its new , whopping 1000 hp , with torque electronically limited at 737 lb-ft. With a top speed of 211 mph , the Mansory Torofeo Huracan crushes 0-62 mph in 2.7 seconds. Inside , a host of new features and Mansory finishes can be easily spotted throughout the cabin .
It ’ s taken a while for Porsche to fully exploit the capabilities of its Cayman mid-engined coupe. And making its official live debut here at Geneva is the 2016 Porsche Cayman GT4 , a track-tuned car that ’ s capable of outperforming and outrunning many ( but not all ) past 911s. The 2011 911 GT3 is just one example. Powered by the 3.8-liter flat six found in the current Carrera S , the Cayman GT4 is 385 hp of pure track attack. 0-60 mph happens in only 4.2 seconds and it ’ s capable of a top track speed of 183 mph. And it looks as incredible in-person as it does in photos. Everything about the Cayman GT4 has been enhanced for the track , including a lowered ride height , an improved braking system consisting of 911 GT3 components , and plenty of added downforce at both axles. The large rear wing also looks fantastic. Step inside and you ’ ll discover options like full bucket seats made of carbon fiber and a Sport Chrono Package. Porsche has already announced that US sales will begin this July. The price ? $ 85,595 , including destination. Considering the level of track performance the Cayman GT4 is capable of , many would say that price is a relative bargain. We can ’ t disagree .
Plenty of automakers make GT3-ready race cars out of high-performance road-going models , but it usually takes a little while after the debut of the road car for the modifications to be performed. Not the case with the new Audi R8 , which has just gotten a new racing version a few days after the debut of the road version. Not only that , but Audi has built it to comply with the FIA GT3 regulations that wo n't even take effect until next year. Audi was clearly planning ahead. Power is bumped up slightly from the road version , with the 5.2-liter V10 producing 585 horsepower. The new version is slightly lighter than the previous R8 LMS as well , going from a weight of 2,750 to 2,695 lbs. Audi says the torsional stiffness has been increased by a whopping 39 percent as well. Aerodynamics have apparently been improved too , although we do n't have any figures for that. Audi sold a total of 130 race-ready versions of the first-gen R8 , quite a large number for a race car. This is why the new version came out so quickly , so that potential customers do n't get impatient and go to Porsche .
Amongst the multitude of new reveals at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show , the recently unveiled Ferrari 488 GTB is understandably getting the most attention as you would expect of any new Prancing Horse. While only subtly different from the 458 Italia in design , add together all the individual body modifications – the blown rear spoiler , the double front spoiler , side air vents , new lights and wheels – and under the show lights the overall finish makes a big impact. Some will call it nothing more than a facelifted 458 , Ferrari never will , and looking at it in person , neither will we. Aggressively poised , it looks ready to attack the road from every angle. The powerplant is a 3.9-liter twin-turbo V8 rated at 660 hp and 560 lb-ft of torque , which is enough to take the 488 GTB to 62 mph in 3.0 seconds and to a top speed of 208 mph. The 458 Italia is one of the most beautiful , most accomplished supercars ever made. But the 488 GTB has the potential to be even better .
Here is something that nobody was expecting to see : an all-wheel drive , all-electric GT/SUV/Crossover concept from where you 'd least expect it , Aston Martin. Dubbed the DBX , the concept blends a world of design styles and categories to create this car that is a bit of everything. As tall as a crossover , it 's shaped like a luxury GT coupe and offers seating for four adults. Though its design is inspired by current firm offerings , it looks nothing like anything the company has ever made before. But is that a good thing ? As concepts go , little is known about this car , but the company says that the DBX will be fully electric , and family and environmentally " friendly " . Not much is known about the car 's electric powertrain , but it is expected to fill the place of Aston 's mammoth V12 engines. Love it or hate it , the DBX should be pointing both at the company 's future design language and its intention of entering unchartered SUV territory , an important category in some if its fastest growing markets .
Looking at this thing in the metal at the Geneva Motor Show and knowing what we do : that it comes packing a drivetrain with this best part of 1,000 horsepower , we ’ re convinced the McLaren P1 GTR will make at least one of its owners soil themselves when they first take it out for a spin. Wearing the iconic yellow and green racing livery from the F1 GTR Le Mans racer , the track-dedicated hypercar is priced at a cool £ 1.9 million and will be offered exclusively to P1 owners , limited to just 35 units. McLaren has somehow managed to strip 50 kg from the already lightweight P1 ( thanks in part to a titanium alloy exhaust and polycarbonate side windows ) , giving the GTR variant a power-to-weight ratio of 684 hp per tonne. It ’ s also improved downforce by ten percent , stretched the front track by 80 mm to enhance front axle grip , lowered the ride height by 50 mm and added some 19-inch rims wrapped in slick rubber. A car designed primarily to set super-hot lap times , the McLaren P1 GTR won ’ t break any speed records , but it will get buyers around tracks quicker than almost any other car on the planet .
Keeping the Geneva show alive and revving , Porsche has just put the spotlight on its spanking new 911 GT3 RS. With the promise of 493 horsepower to be delivered from its brand-new , naturally aspirated , 4.0-liter six cylinder engine , the 2016 model will offer 384 lb-ft of torque ( 15 more than before ) . The engine gets new cooling elements and sends its power to the rear wheels. Coupled with a seven-speed dual clutch PDK transmission , available variable locking differential and advanced torque vectoring system , the GT3 RS promises to hit 62 mph in 3.3 seconds. Despite a long list of new parts and performance bits , the 2016 GT3 RS weighs in at just 1420 kg ( 10 kg below the 911 GT3 ) . Visual changes from the GT3 include new ( 911 Turbo-like ) side air intakes , front wings with air ducts and more pronounced front splitter. A magnesium roof and carbon fiber reinforced plastic hood and trunklid cover assist in trimming the weight off. Additional downforce is offered with a massive rear wing. Inside , looks are differentiated by a white rev counter , body-colored upholstery and three-spoke Alcantara steering wheel , in addition to some extra carbon fiber sprinkled across the dash and door panels .
After revealing the Regera , which blends track fun with open road usability , Koenigsegg is back with another reveal that proves exactly where its roots are. The Agera RS , a Swedish carbon-fiber monster , has come to take Geneva back to the track. Sharing its looks with the familiar Agera , the RS 's nearly every component , including the wheels , are made of pure carbon fiber , allowing the car to weigh in at just 3,000 lbs. The Agera 's 7-speed paddle shift is carried through to this model. Boasting a 5.0-liter twin-turbo V8 that guns out 1160 horsepower , the Agera RS out-powers its lesser Agera R brother by 45 hp. The company promises that the RS will become " the ultimate track tool , " a boast that is easily backed up by these astounding numbers. So what 's new for the RS ? Koenigsegg has added advanced sound insulation , a new track-optimized front splitter and winglets , new side skirts , a dynamic underbody flap system and active dynamic rear spoiler. Improved air outlets surround the wheels , and the rpm limit has been raised. Despite opting for an optimized regular gas pump , some markets will enjoy an optional E85 flex fuel capability .
After proving that it can go faster and lighter than just about anyone , Koenigsegg says it is ready to take the leap into true luxury territory. Introducing the Regera , a megacar that promises to be as mind-blowing on the open road as it is on track – the fastest accelerating , most powerful production car ever. Limited to 80 hand-crafted units and with a powertrain based on Koenigsegg 's dry-sump twin turbo , DOHC , 5.0 liter V8 , the Regera will offer 1500 horsepower and 1475 lb-ft of torque ( 700 hp electric ) . It will reach 400 km/h ( 248 mph ) in under 20 seconds , pushed by a Direct Drive combustion engine. The Regera sheds weight , energy loss and fuel consumption by doing away with the traditional transmission , offering the world 's most power-dense battery system and highest electric energy storage capacity of any hypercar. With a 50 km EV range , it promises to still produce a unique sound from its " fish tail " exhaust. A long list of 'world firsts ' includes a fully foldable , active top-mounted rear wing , and fully robotized car body ( including front and rear hoods , doors , mirrors , wing , change port and more ) , all with soft-close functionality and controlled by app or remote .
It ’ s been around a decade since Honda offered a Civic hatchback in the US. At the time , Americans preferred sedans and coupes ( not to mention SUVs ) , while hatchbacks were too often equated as wagon-like. But things are a bit different today. Hatchbacks may still not be overwhelmingly popular in the US , but there ’ s now the Ford Focus , Mazda3 , and VW Golf hatchbacks that sell in respectable numbers. According to the Japanese Nikkei and The Truth About Cars , Honda will send the next generation Civic hatchback to the US in 2016 , although in limited numbers. It will , as it is now , be produced in the UK. The US is expected to receive around 30,000 to 40,000 Civic hatchbacks per year. Now , does this mean the US will also see the Civic Type R hot hatch ? Possibly the next generation but definitely not the one that just launched earlier this month at Geneva. So why is Honda doing this ? For starters , Honda wants to compete against those aforementioned US market hatchbacks , but that UK plant is being underutilized and churning out more cars for a new market should fix that .
Maserati has been doing a solid job of reinventing itself over the past few years. The introduction of the Ghibli and the launch of the latest Quattroporte are crystal clear examples the Italian carmaker wants to continue to expand in a market normally dominated by the Germans. Why settle for an expensive , but common , BMW or Mercedes when you can have something much more special from Italy ? That ’ s , more or less , what Maserati has been pushing , but perhaps that ’ s still not enough. Automotive News Europe is reporting that Maserati parent company Fiat Chrysler ( FCA ) is cutting the number of production shifts at the Gruglicasco facility where the two sedans are built from 12 to 10 per week. Maserati previously stated that it would like to sell some 50,000 units this year and 75,000 by 2018. However , Maserati is now only predicting it ’ ll sell around 30,000 Ghiblis and Quattroportes combined. Only around 3,500 GranTurismos were sold last year , and that number isn ’ t expected to increase. So what can we take away from this ? Maserati needs to launch its Levante SUV and the Alfieri sports car ASAP. In the meantime , perhaps it really needs to figure out how to sell more sedans .
Despite being better known for turning Nissan GT-Rs into 1,000-hp animals , Alpha-N Performance has been working on an upgrade for the BMW M4 for some time. The German tuner has just revealed the finished article in the form of a carbon-fiber body kit and performance upgrade. In terms of the styling , the BMW M4 receives a new front bumper , GT4-style dive planes , a rear diffuser with either short or long fins , a trunk lid spoiler and adjustable wing with optional spoiler. The 3.0-liter turbocharged six-cylinder powerplant has been upped from 425 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque to 530 hp and 506 lb-ft thanks to a multi-channel chip tuning box and a stainless-steel exhaust system. Other mods include a new set of alloys from either OZ Racing or mbDESIGN , while an Ohlins fully-adjustable coilover suspension will be available from June .
Every year JD Power and Associates release its Customer Service Index , a survey that provides customer satisfaction results regarding automakers in a number of categories. We ’ re sure you ’ ve seen automakers promote their high ratings ( if they get them ) in TV commercials. And while American brands like Buick , GMC , and Chevrolet were among the highest rated in the mass market category among those polled , there was another US automaker that scored at the very opposite end of the spectrum. Coming in at the bottom was Jeep , with a score of 740 on a 1,000-point scale. Just ahead of it was Dodge ( 749 points ) , then Ram ( 756 ) , Fiat ( 762 ) , and Chrysler ( 775 ) . Specifically , the survey contains data from 70,000 owners and lessees dating from 2010 to 2014. They were polled about customer satisfaction in terms of maintenance and repair service at franchised dealers. This isn ’ t to say Chrysler products are bad or completely unreliable , it ’ s just that customers weren ’ t pleased with their ownership experience , mainly because of the dealerships. Clearly dealership experience is something vital if automakers want returning customers .
The BMW E30 M3 has been increasing in value over the past couple of years for many reasons. It is the original M3 , the very start of the iconic nameplate. Obviously it ’ s grown in size and power since 1985 , and the E30 M3 is the car that ’ s consistently remained a fan favorite. How come ? Because everything about it just worked , and worked damn well. BMW design director Adrian van Hooydonk recently spoke to Autocar and stated that " The E30 M3 has a really big fan base , and we are going to be taking cues from it for a future product. " This September the M2 will debut , the modern day M car that ’ ll be most similar size-wise to the E30. And next year will be BMW ’ s 100th anniversary. Because of those factors , a pretty good guess is that there ’ s going to be some sort of special edition M2 to commemorate both. If so , what changes can we expect ? " With M cars , " van Hooydonk continued , " we try to get the downforce right without moveable aero. It ’ s the only authentic way. " So , perhaps , uniquely shaped wheel arches reminiscent of the E30 M3 ? A fixed rear wing ? Both are entirely possible and we ’ re anxious to see what turns up .
Massive new features are coming to the Tesla Model S this year , with an update that will “ end range anxiety ” to be rolled out in a few weeks , followed by a comprehensive software update that will transform the Model S into a self-driving car that can be summoned by your smartphone. Range Assurance is the first feature Elon Musk announced as part of the Version 6.2 over-the-air software update. Essentially , it ’ s an app that talks with the Supercharger network and parking-spot chargers in your vicinity , while keeping an eye on your battery. When juice is low , it will provide of a list of the nearest places to recharge , and will warn you if your heading on a trip without enough juice to make it to a charging facility. It will then guide you to the nearest spot if the driver so desires. Musk said the new feature will make it “ basically impossible for a Model S driver to run out of range unintentionally , ” and will also factor in the likes of temperature , traffic flow and headwinds to ensure an accurate estimate of battery range. For long-distance trips , Tesla has introduced Trip Planner. This new bit of kit will help Model S drivers to factor in the location of Superchargers and calculate the best route to the intended destination , indicating where and for how long you ’ ll have to stop to charge along the way .
A few months ago , those mid-engine Corvette rumors started up again , but there was an element of truth to them. Various sources claimed that GM was working on a new mid-engine , high-performance sports car setup. Could that be the Corvette C8 ? Could Zora Arkus-Duntov 's vision finally happen ? Possibly , but then earlier this week during a live interview , Corvette chief engineer Tadge Juechter claimed he knew nothing about this , stating that he ’ ll " have to check that out , because I know no such car exists. " And now a new theory has arisen , courtesy of Automobile Magazine editor-in-chief Todd Lassa. In his most recent column , Lassa suggests that GM could very well be developing that mid-engine platform , but it ’ s for a future Cadillac sports car and not for the Corvette. He points out a few reasons why this is entirely probable. Aside from Juechter ’ s recent comments , Lassa notes that Cadillac ’ s president has gone on record that the brand needs sports cars. " We should also look at one or two sports cars that you buy for emotional reasons , not for practicality , but because they ’ re so sexy and fun to drive. " Cadillac has also adopted a new accounting system that ’ ll make it easier to justify the costs of a high-priced , low-volume sports car .
With Easter coming up soon , Jeep has held with tradition and released some new concepts to be shown at the annual Jeep Safari event in Moab , UT. There are seven different concepts this year , and we 've included a couple of photos of each. Three of these are based on the Wrangler. There 's the Red Rock Responder , a support vehicle , the Wrangler Africa , which is lifted and diesel powered , and the Staff Car , which is very much dressed up to look like one of its WWII Willys ancestors. The Grand Cherokee Overlander provides a trail-running alternative to the Wrangler. The Desert Hawk follows the weird Jeep tradition of sticking maps on the hoods of Renegade show cars , and the Cherokee Canyon Trail has one too , as well as a roof bike rack. But perhaps the most interesting is the Chief , made out of a Seventies Cherokee. It 's a sort of pro touring approach to the concept , with modern suspension and brake components , as well as a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 under the hood. The paint is all period correct though , and the design has held up quite well .
China is a notorious polluter , but that didn ’ t stop Nissan from making the country the only place you can buy its new Murano Hybrid. The new CUV was revealed at the 2015 Shanghai Auto Show. It shares an identical exterior and interior with its petrol-powered brother. The difference , of course , lies under the hood. A supercharged 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine from the Infiniti QX60 Hybrid does the heavy lifting and is good for 250 horsepower. An electric motor kicking in another 20 horsepower helps the Murano hybrid earn its green stripes. Nissan says the engine will offer the “ powerful driving performance ” of the Murano 's optional 3.5-liter V6 and the fuel economy of the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The hybrid hits Chinese dealers this summer , with no word on whether or not it ’ ll arrive in other markets .
Morgans are hard to describe. The automaker ’ s most popular Plus 4 model somehow blends old-world charm and modern technology into a fun package. AR Motorsport , the team responsible for getting Morgans on the track , has worked its magic and created the beautiful Morgan AR P4. The AR P4 is limited to 50 models , packs a Cosworth engine under its hood , has larger brakes , an adjustable suspension , a revised chassis and a new axle ratio. Cosworth has gone to town on Ford ’ s 2.0-liter engine , which now produces 225 hp. Now word on performance , but the AR P4 should be able to get to 62 mph in approximately six seconds. The AR P4 isn ’ t all go , however. The company has spent a lot of time in making the sporty Morgan more enjoyable on the road. The vehicle benefits from a new dash , better soundproofing and LED lighting. To put the AR P4 over the top , there ’ s exposed aluminum , plenty of ash wood and stylish leather. At roughly $ 85,400 , the AR P4 is the Morgan we ’ d have and the one we lust over .
Ford just showed the new top-line F-150 Limited but pricing info wasn ’ t released. This has led to rampant speculation that begins with the F-150 Platinum. This is the current king of the F-Series and a cursory search reveals that the top-tier four-wheel drive model starts at $ 55,305. The Limited will be above the Platinum and offer four-wheel drive , which means there will probably be two price tiers. So , how much would you be willing to pay ? There ’ s no doubt that the Limited will be extremely capable and luxurious. It ’ s basically a full-size luxury sedan that can also effortlessly tow a boat. Still , is Mojave leather , a remote tailgate and exclusive 22-inch wheels ( among many , many other goodies ) worth paying potentially north of $ 60,000 for ? Hell , we honestly wouldn ’ t be shocked if a fully loaded limited sold for between $ 65,000 and $ 70,000. The big question is what will Limited owners do with their trucks ? Will they double-dip , running the family around in luxury while towing the boat and a bunch of cement bags ? Or will the Limited merely be an overpriced status symbol that moonlights as a pickup ?
About six months ago , Georgia-based aftermarket tuner Vengeance Racing set out to accomplish the daunting task of building the world ’ s most powerful Chevrolet Corvette Z06. There has been some anticipation since the tuner declared its intent and now , only half a year later , it seems as if things are starting to come to fruition. Over the past several months , one particular Z06 has undergone heavy modifications and now features a larger supercharger , new camshafts and headers , nitrous oxide , and plenty of other upgrades. Vengeance Racing has now officially released the dyno test results and the numbers are absolutely monstrous. According to the dyno , this Z06 is capable of producing a massive 1,088 hp at the rear wheels and 1079 lb-ft of torque. Although the work on this piece of all-American awesomeness is still ongoing , the Vengeance Racing team plans to take the car to the drag strip for some official testing. We look forward to seeing the results of the quarter mile runs , 0-60 mph times and , hopefully , an insane top speed. We 'll keep you posted .
The official title bestowed upon this gorgeous Pagani Huayra is " The King. " What makes it worthy of such a lofty title ? After all , there are plenty of other amazing supercars out there that could also be worthy of being called The King. Well , this Huayra is not just your average Huayra. The King is a 1 of 1 of 1 and is adorned with a multitude of special custom features that set it apart from other Huayras. Gloss carbon fiber is slathered over about two thirds of the vehicle and there 's a deep red and white paint scheme that makes it totally one of a kind. The custom exterior is matched by an equally impressive interior filled with carbon fiber and black and white leather. It ’ s unconfirmed whether or not there are any mechanical features that set the engine of this Huayra apart , but at the very least it is powered by the standard 6.0-liter V12 that produces 720 hp and 740 lb-ft of torque .
According to Auto Express , Audi has revealed that the new RS4 and the following RS5 Coupe could feature a 3.0-liter V6 engine with an electric turbocharger. The setup would allow the vehicles to create a massive amount of horsepower without any lag while achieving better fuel economy. Sounds like the perfect engine , right ? The complicated system is powered by batteries , which are charged through a generator that regains lost energy through braking. There is one major drawback to an electric turbocharger : cost. The electrical system is much more expensive than the traditional method of diminishing turbo lag and will only be found on Audi ’ s top-end models. An electric turbocharger would help the RS4 and RS5 keep pace with the Mercedes C63 AMG and may also find its way into the new R8. Rumor has it that the new RS models will have over 480 hp , which is 30 hp more than the current model , but roughly 20 hp less than the C63 AMG. The rivalry between the RS4/RS5 and C63 AMG will be closer than ever , but we ’ re worried about the lack of horsepower in the R8 if it were to get the same engine .
The fifth-generation of Nissan 's GT-R Skyline is often considered as one of the greatest JDM vehicles ever produced. The R34 Skyline was initially introduced to the Japanese market in 1999 and was made famous when it appeared in " 2 Fast 2 Furious " . The limited V-Spec version of this already insane car , featured in this article , boasts an ATTESA E-TS Pro system suspension kit that provides it with even tighter handling than the regular version. One of these awesome GT-R Skyline V-Specs was acquired by Australia ’ s Mercury Motorsport and given some very cool modifications that took the car to producing an astounding 1,100 hp at the wheels. So what did these crazy Australian gearheads do to take this V-Spec R34 over the 1,000 hp mark ? The most significant of a series of upgrades involved a collaboration with Nitto Performance Engineering that completely replaced the Tomei 2.8 stroker engine with a Nitto 2.7 stoker and teamed it with a massive GT47R turbo. Although some of the modifications were eventually changed to make the car more drivable on public roads , this R34 is still capable of producing over 1,000 hp .
We see car crashes and their aftermaths all the time. It ’ s become a regular occurrence , so it ’ ll take quite something to make us do a double take. This is that something. The Knoxville , Tennessee , WBIR NBC affiliate has just reported about this Chevrolet Camaro that somehow ended on top of a parked Subaru Outback. Another driver snapped images of the aftermath of the crash that local authorities are still trying to figure out how exactly happened. What ’ s known is that the Subaru owner was inside a store when the Camaro came crashing down on top. The Camaro driver was able to jump down from the car after performing their best " Dukes of Hazzard " stunt impression. Fortunately , no one was hurt. Anyone have any theories as to how this Camaro ended up where it did ? Photos courtesy of wbir.com/Wendy Tittsworth .
What you ’ re looking at is the 400th Ferrari Enzo built. In fact , it was made specifically for His Holiness Pope John Paul II. We always figured him as a closeted gearhead. And now it ’ s up for sale , part of that " Pinnacle Collection " of 30 cars that ’ ll be auctioned off next month at Pebble Beach. Obviously every single Enzo made is special , but this one is more so. Aside from its famous original owner , Enzo # 400 was one of very few examples finished in Rosso Scuderia exterior paint. It 's also fitted with unique options such as Daytona seats and a carbon fiber rear spoiler. It ’ s even considered to be in as-new condition , with a total of only 111 miles ( 179 km ) on the odometer. Still not special enough for you ? Open the trunk lid and you ’ ll notice something. Call it human handwriting , if you will. It ’ s a single sentence , written in Italian , from Luca Di Montezemolo , the former Ferrari Chairman. Translated into English , it says : " This Enzo , unique in the history of Ferrari , as a sign of solidarity for those suffering , inspired by a Great Pope , John Paul II. " Presented to the Pope in January 2005 , who requested Ferrari sell it and donate the proceeds to Southeast Asia tsunami victims .
Apple wanting to build a car isn ’ t news. These rumors have been swirling for some time now and the tech company hasn ’ t done much to dispel them , unless you count hiring battery experts en masse as squashing a story. Then Apple has done a fine job ! The latest twist in the saga is the hiring of Doug Betts , the former quality vice president at Fiat Chrysler Automotive ( FCA ) . The Detroit Free Press lays out a few reasons as to why this hiring is big news. First off , Betts is a big player in the auto industry with tons of resources. When he joined Chrysler in 2007 he already had 21 years of experience in the industry. In addition to his quality work at FCA , he also held high-level manufacturing positions at both Nissan and Toyota. According to the Detroit Free Press , Betts is one of Apple ’ s first auto industry hires to not have a background in tech. He ’ s a car guy , which means he won ’ t exactly be of much use designing iPhones or tablets. Rumor has it that Apple wants its car by 2020 , which means we could see a bunch of other auto execs lured away by bags of money between now and then .
About two years ago , a used Ferrari 308 GTB , or its 328 successor , could be had for around $ 40,000. The 308/328 were simply affordable. As an added bonus , the targa topped 308 GTS was the Ferrari of choice for " Magnum P.I , " everyone ’ s favorite 1980s moustached , Hawaiian-shirt-wearing private eye. But look at the price of a 308 GTB/GTS today and you might be shocked at what you ’ ll see. Some are now listed for $ 100,000 or more. What ’ s the reason for this price surge ? Remember , Ferraris in general have a history of increasing in value. Are collectors now re-assessing another Ferrari classic ? Perhaps our friend Mike Brewer , star and host of Wheeler Dealers , can provide a better explanation thanks to his endless knowledge of buying , selling , and restoring classic cars. He ’ ll be holding a car clinic this Sunday , July 26 , at the Silverstone Classic where he ’ ll offer his advice and take audience questions .
This is something Rolls-Royce has been debating for some time now. On the one hand , building its own SUV would bring in some serious cash as well as attract more customers , particularly in China. On the other , an SUV , if not done properly , could harm the historic UK brand. Fortunately , Rolls-Royce CEO Torsten Muller-Otvos has just confirmed to AutoExpress that a final decision will made this year regarding production of a future SUV. “ We are listening to what our customers are saying and this segment is interesting because it allows transport for your family … on the other hand we need to watch that it keeps the promises of what Rolls-Royce really stands for – that ’ s magic carpet ride , fully luxury , no compromises in comfort. ” Coming off a fantastic 2014 sales year , Muller-Otvos obviously doesn ’ t want to ruin a good trend or bring any shame to the brand. But he also sees an opening for an even larger future luxury SUV market. “ You need to move the brand from time to time , you need to go with the flow. We might even see in a few years that the classical sedan segments are shrinking due to the fact that SUV type vehicles are growing. ”
Even back in the 1970s Datsuns , notably the 510 , were sometimes considered the so-called poor man ’ s BMW. Datsun , as we all know , is now Nissan. But many consider the Japanese automaker ’ s heyday to be when it called itself Datsun. Adam Corolla in particular is a huge Datsun guy. So was Paul Newman. And now Matt Farah counts himself as one. On this latest episode of Tuned on the Drive network , Farah gets behind the wheel of a turbocharged Datsun 510. Originally it produced just 95 hp but thanks to that turbo it now spits out four times that. And its weighs just under 2,400 pounds. Owner Rick is very much a Datsun man , owning a couple of others as well. But this old 510 two-door was reborn for track day events. It even scares Farah a bit at first due to its lack of electronic , well , everything .
Detroit Electric already premiered its first model , the SP : 01 , some time ago but now the final production version is ready. Set to go on sale in Asia , Europe , and North America next year , the carbon fiber-bodied , two-seater SP : 01 is powered by a 210 kW electric motor that produces 285 hp mated to a manual gearbox. A single-speed and twin-speed automatic is optional. The company claims a 0-60 mph time of 3.7 seconds and a top speed of 155 mph. And no , your eyes aren ’ t fooling you. The SP : 01 is based off the Lotus Elise , just like the Tesla Roadster. However , Detroit Electric , which isn ’ t even based in Detroit ( more on that shortly ) , promised the SP : 01 would be good to go in 2014. Clearly it wasn ’ t. 2016 is the new date. Since its initial debut at the 2013 Shanghai Motor Show , we can see there have been a few exterior improvements , mainly in regards to aerodynamics. The rear end is now a fastback design and there ’ s also a new rear spoiler and diffuser. Detroit Electric claims buyers will have a variety of exterior styling options and paint choices. Inside , it looks like an Elise with an 8.4-inch , Tesla-inspired touchscreen. Pricing will start at around $ 135K .
German ’ s big three ( luxury car brands ) all enjoyed record sales in the US last year , but it was BMW that took the crown for the most sales from Mercedes-Benz , shifting a phenomenal 339,738 vehicles , a 9.8 percent increase on the record 309,280 sold in 2013. It ’ s bread-and-butter 3 Series/4 Series was the most popular model , with 142,232 units sold. In second place , Mercedes enjoyed a 5.7 percent increase over the 312,534 units sold in 2013 with figures of 330,391 for 2014. The C-Class was the best-selling Silver Star , with 75,065 units finding buyers. Way back in fourth , Audi sold 182,011 vehicles , an impressive 15.2 percent rise over 2013. The Q5 was its most popular model , with 42,420 unit sales being made. Making up the top five , Lexus finished third with 311,389 cars sold , enjoying the biggest gain amongst the top three with sales rising 13.7 percent. Cadillac was down 6.5 percent to 170,750 , ending the year in fifth. Other luxury brands included : Acura whose sales rose 1.5 percent to 167,843 units ; Infiniti with an 0.8 percent rise to 117,300 units ; and Lincoln , who enjoyed a 16 percent bump to 94,474 units .
It ’ s been a long time since the US had a Buick convertible. The semi-luxury brand once built some absolutely gorgeous convertibles , but that was way , way back when. Think around World War II. That was the Buick convertible 's heyday. But Buick was given an extra shot at life by surviving GM ’ s bankruptcy and since then it ’ s been thriving. New and younger buyers have consistently been walking into showrooms and Buick executives are fully aware something is missing : a convertible. That ’ ll change next week when Buick unveils its latest model , which will essentially be a rebadged version of the Opel Cascade. We already know that Buick recently trademarked the name " Velite , " so that name is a strong possibility. But just because this will be a rebadged Opel doesn ’ t mean it ’ ll be a bad thing. The Cascade is totally worthy of a Buick badge. Power will likely come from a 1.6-liter four-cylinder with 200 hp. Obviously we ’ ll have complete details for you shortly but knowing Buick ’ s current pricing , its new convertible will likely carry a base price of nearly $ 30,000 .
A total of about 1,400 vehicles were on this cargo ship when it was forced to run aground on a bank in the UK. The combined value of all of those vehicles is about $ 53 million , according to the latest reports. Called the Hoegh Osaka , the 590-foot ship weighs 57,000 tons and was making its way from the British port of Southampton to Bremerhaven , Germany. The ship ’ s crew deliberately ran it aground off the Isle of Wight on Saturday after it developed problems and started to list , meaning it started to tilt to the side. No serious injuries were reported and the crew was airlifted to safety. Tug boats tried to free the ship , but that proved unsuccessful. On a brighter note , all of those cars are not only fully insured but are still " strapped down in position " and may not be seriously damaged. For now the goal is to free the ship then inspect its cargo .
The thing which probably makes the Ariel Nomad so loveable is not that someone built a really fast dune buggy. That , we 've seen before. What 's great about the Nomad is that it is also street legal , and is therefore insanely fast wherever it goes. Revealed last month , we now have specs , and so know for certain that it is insanely fast. The 2.4-liter four-cylinder Honda engine with Ariel software makes 235 horsepower and 221 lb-ft of torque , allowing for a 0-60 time of 3.4 seconds. The vehicle weighs just 670 kg ( 1,474 lbs ) , which is n't much more than the road-only version , despite the extra off-road equipment. The price has been set at £ 30,000 ( $ 45,503 ) , which is obviously not cheap , but still comes in towards the lower end of the Ariel lineup. Ariel has even gone so far as to say that the Nomad could be competitive in the Dakar Rally , pretty much the ultimate in off-road motorsports. It stopped short of saying the car would win , but did say that it could make an impressive showing. We see no reason to doubt that , and you wo n't either once you see the video on the next page .
Dating back to late 2013 , rumors began about a potential Aston Martin Vantage GT3 road car in development. In essence , this would be an even more extreme version of the Vantage V12 S. The production rumors were more or less confirmed by some prototypes caught testing last fall , but only now has the UK sports car builder confirmed the GT3 ’ s existence. This new teaser makes it quite clear. Set to debut this March at Geneva this is the fully street legal Vantage GT3. Aside from the brief video , AM hasn ’ t released any official specs or other details , but it ’ s safe to assume the following : that familiar 6.0-liter V12 could be tuned to produce as much as 600 hp , up from the current 565 ponies in the V12 Vantage S. An updated automated-manual gearbox is also expected , allowing for faster shifts and a 0-62 mph time of roughly 3.5 seconds. A stripped-out interior and a combination of aluminum and carbon-fiber bodywork will further reduce weight. There ’ ll also be flared wheel arches front and rear to accommodate the wider tires. It all sounds quite wonderful and more details should be coming in shortly .
Land Rover will spend the next year celebrating the iconic Defender , and has kicked off the party by unveiling a trio of limited edition models and creating a unique 1km sand drawing in the UK. Why , you may ask ? Because 68 years ago , Rover ’ s engineering director Maurice Wilks first sketched the outline of the original Land Rover in the sand of Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey. He conceived a vehicle that could act as both tractor and off-roader , and his design was christened ‘ Land Rover. ’ The one-kilometer-long temporary artwork was created using six Land Rovers , each towing a 12-foot harrow as they made one continuous 4.52-km line , which was soon erased by the incoming tide. The three limited edition Defenders honor a different element of its versatile character. The Autobiography Edition offers more performance , luxury and comfort , boasting a two-tone paint job , LED lights , a power boost to 148 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque , Santorini Black detailing , and full Windsor leather interior. Based on a 90 Station Wagon , just 80 units will be made priced from £ 61,845. Inspired by early models , the Heritage Edition comes in Grasmere Green with a contrasting white roof , a heritage grille , and HUE 166 graphics – a nod to the license plate of ‘ Huey , ’ the first ever pre-production Series 1 Land Rover. Limited to 400 units , it will come priced from £ 27,800 .
