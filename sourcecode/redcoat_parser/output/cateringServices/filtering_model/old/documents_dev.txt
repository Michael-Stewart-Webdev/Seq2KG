It ’ s taken him a couple years , but acclaimed Mexico City chef Enrique Olvera is about ready to close the doors at his fine-dining sensation Pujol. In the coming weeks , he ’ ll be relocating Pujol to a stunner of a space : It ’ s minimalist but lush , clean but inviting , ultra Right This Moment but also timeless. Diners who are familiar with Olvera ’ s hit New York City restaurant Cosme will also see some familiar aesthetic choices. “ I realized with Cosme that I like restaurants that are fun , ” he told the New York Times earlier this month. “ I like restaurants that are not special-occasion restaurants , and where people can just come in and relax and have a beautiful time. ” To that end , there ’ s plenty of bar space , and the wood tables will remain tablecloth-free. Olvera is heeding the call heard by chefs around the world , and focusing almost exclusively on wood-fired cooking. With a grill and a hearth , the new Pujol kitchen is noticeably short on stovetop burners. Instead , there ’ s a comal ( a cast iron flat top for tortillas ) and outside , a brick oven for dishes like barbacoa. There ’ s also a backyard herb garden.
Gail Halvorsen was a pilot for the United States Air Force during World War II , and he took part in the Berlin Airlift at the end of the war. With Berlin controlled by Russian forces , the U.S. and its allies flew missions over the city and dropped food to prevent starvation. While this was a noble effort , Halvorsen stood out as a hero to children because he devoted his time to dropping candy. " I knew that there had not had chocolate in stores in Berlin for two years , " Halvorsen explains in the video. " By the time he was done , the pilot dropped 23 tons of chocolate from his plane. Children knew to look for him , because Alverson told them he would " wiggle " his wings over the airfield. " From then on , I was known in the press and all the kids in Berlin — 'That 's Uncle Wiggly Wings ! " Alverson says.
Already with a restaurant , cookbook , and plenty of television appearances under her belt , Alex Guarnaschelli is taking the next logical step for the modern celebrity chef : She 's heading to the stage. Guarnaschelli will appear live at Guild Hall in East Hampton , N.Y. , on August 5 , reports Hamptons Magazine. She 'll be joined by comedians Judy Gold , Karen Bergreen , and Yamaneika Saunders , and she plans to deliver a standup routine of her own. " I realized in the past couple of years that the kitchen on any given evening during dinner service is really the same as an improv comedy show , " the Chopped judge and Iron Chef told Hamptons. Firing dishes to order , entertaining guests , and accepting almost instant feedback are all things restaurant staff deal with daily , so she has a point. She 'll reportedly deliver a set called " Busting My Chops , " with material heavily based on her culinary background.
Happy Friday. Last night Hillary Clinton became the first woman to accept a major party 's nomination for President , so take the weekend to let that sink in. Meanwhile , what would a State dinner look like under a Trump White House ? A lavish black-tie affair complete with a string orchestra , caviar , and ( well-done ) steak , probably. Or maybe just McDonald 's hamburgers served on fancy china. In more food news today : the next Paula Deen is maybe not who you 'd expect ; a look inside Andy Warhol 's vintage cookbook ; and the highly bureaucratic process of redesigning nutrition labels. — Pop star Katy Perry says in 30 years , she 'll look just like Paula Deen. It 's not quite clear how either party feels about this. — Shake Shack 's opening day in Seoul drew a crowd of over 1,000 fans. — Italian megamarket Eataly is preparing to open its newest location in downtown Manhattan , and this one 's got something the others do n't : bread from all over the world. Starting this fall , it will host bakeries from across the globe — think Japan , Brazil , and Turkey — for month-long residencies.
Cronut mastermind Dominique Ansel is just days away from unveiling his new London bakery. Set to open September 30 in the West London neighborhood of Belgravia , the superstar pastry chef ’ s third outpost is considerably larger than its NYC and Tokyo counterparts , spanning two stories. " I grew up in France , just a train ride away from London , but never had a chance to visit there until I was much older , " Ansel tells Eater , explaining why he decided to open a new location in the city. " For each new city that we go to , it ’ s about choosing somewhere that both inspires and challenges us , and London does just that. We were also confident we could find a quality team with pastry talent throughout Europe , and access to ingredients from all across the country — that European butter ! I 've been waiting to work with it for so long. "
Even if you strategically plan out your entire day of rides and rollercoasters down to the minute , deploying the FastPass+ reservation system and taking advantage of the parks ' early-open/late-close Extra Magic Hours , you 're still going to reach a point at Walt Disney World where you get off a thrilling ride , lurch out unsteadily into the sunlight , and say to yourself , " God , I could really use a drink.

A restaurant critic in Richmond , Virginia has been dismissed for plagiarism. In a letter to its readers , the Richmond Times-Dispatch ’ s executive editor Paige Mudd wrote that freelance writer Elliott Shaffner had apparently copied “ a number of sections of this week ’ s dining review ” from an L.A. Weekly restaurant review. After realizing that Shaffner ’ s most recent review contained work that was not her own , the Times-Dispatch investigated further and found that wasn ’ t the critic ’ s only instance of plagiarism. The Times-Dispatch has since scrubbed its site of all of Shaffner ’ s work , but a look at one of her recent reviews ( archived on the internet ) indeed reveals striking similarities to a 2009 L.A. Weekly story. From the July 20 , 2016 Richmond Times-Dispatch , a review by Shaffner : And from L.A. Weekly ’ s 2009 story , “ Jonathan Gold 's 99 Essential L.A. Restaurants ” :
At first look , that little contraption with the words “ Mac & Cheese Nation ” on it looks like a cross between an electric kettle and a children ’ s toy. And so it ’ s posing a question : Is this hideous device , despite the fact that it may save you time on your next bowl of mac and cheese , worth having at home where visitors could see it ? Does it reign supreme to just a pot of boiling water ? We ’ ll start our theory with bringing water to a boil , a process that ’ s three minutes shorter when using the mac and cheese maker. There do seem to be some downsides to the maker : It ’ s plastic and a little flimsy , so longevity isn ’ t a selling point ; and the crank system is rendered useless while the pouring spout on top is being used. But if you ’ re an avid mac and cheese chef , maybe you need a little more research to decide if this is something you should actually buy.
Scoring is totally arbitrary , of course , with the exception of these points : • 1 point for staying in the competition • 2 points for making it to the top three in a challenge • 5 points for winning a challenge • 3 points for making me cry • 50 point deduction for being eliminated There are significant moments in history that illustrate the perseverance of feminism. In 1920 the suffragettes fought hard for our right to vote. In 1972 we got the Equal Rights Amendment. In 2001 , peak Britney Spears danced with a seven-foot albino python on stage at the MTV Video Music Awards. And on January 29 , 2016 , we have our first girl winner of MasterChef Junior. I know the above paragraph may seem to devalue this momentous occasion , but I assure you , this is actually a huge deal. In four seasons of the show , this is the first time a girl will inevitably win the title. Until this point , only one girl had made it to the final round.
Goop , arguably the most irritating of all the wealthy white woman lifestyle brands , has become synonymous with its founder Gwyneth Paltrow , and vice versa. But now , the Guardian reports , the actress says she wants to step back from Goop. " In order to build the brand I want to build , its scalability is limited if I connect to it , " Paltrow reportedly said at a conference in Chicago. " My dream is that one day no one will remember that I had anything to do with it. " Paltrow — who once told Conan O'Brien she 'd " rather die than let [ her ] kid eat Cup-A-Soup " — launched Goop as a weekly email newsletter in 2008 , and it has since evolved into a full-on # brand replete with pop-up shops and an e-commerce site hawking $ 458 porcelain bowls and its own line of skincare products. So why the need for such a " conscious uncoupling " ? After all , supreme lifestyle queen and Paltrow nemesis Martha Stewart has achieved astronomic success with her own namesake brand. Perhaps it 's because Paltrow , who at one point suggested that parents with " regular " jobs maybe have it easier than Hollywood elite , realizes people find her incredibly pretentious and she wants to set Goop free from these constraints.
Appealing to the inner college kid in us all , a brewery has dreamed up a beer inspired by Nissin Cup Noodles , complete with a label that calls to mind the instant ramen classic. Texas-based the Collective Brewing Project , which focuses on “ funky and sour ” beers , released Cup O ’ Beer earlier this month , Tasting Table reports. The sour Gose-style beer was brewed with actual ramen noodles — 55 pounds of them , to be exact — and the final product is “ light and tart ” with notes of ginger , lime , lemongrass , and a seaweed-cured sea salt , the brewery ’ s Facebook page notes. But the beer is not nearly as attainable as its inspiration. Collective Brewing Project is distributing bottles , which cost $ 7 each , at select locations throughout Texas , and serving the frankenbrew on draft in their Fort Worth draft room — out of styrofoam cups , we hope.
Earlier today , Chipotle released a new meat choice for its burritos and tacos and bowls : Its chorizo is billed as a chicken and pork sausage that 's seasoned with cumin , paprika , and chipotle. We sent two Eater NY critics — Robert Sietsema and Ryan Sutton — to give it a taste. Read their tasting notes , below. Ryan weighs in : I 've always been more of a Taco Bell guy than a Chipotle guy in the world of Tex-Mex. That 's not to say I dine at either more than , say , once every few years , but from a culinary standpoint , what Taco Bell does is more niche : It serves creative junk food you ca n't get anywhere else. It 's a magical place where Mountain Dew becomes a breakfast drink , where Doritos become taco shells , and and where cheesy El Salvadorian Pupusas become , well , they become taco shells too , acting as an edible catcher 's mitt of sorts for scrambled eggs at breakfast. Try asking for a Cool Ranch taco at any other Mexican restaurant in the U.S. No dice.
As the unhinged , oft-lamented year 2017 careens toward its merciful end , Eater takes a look back at what actually happened in North America ’ s dining capitals. Despite what commenters on Facebook would prefer , politics definitely didn ’ t stay out of food this year ; whether it was changes in tipping or immigration laws , the restaurant industry stepped to the plate , supporting causes like a Day Without a Woman and a Day Without Immigrants. Meanwhile , the post-Ailes , post-Weinstein moment in America quickly found its way to the restaurant industry , where titans of the field like John Besh and Mario Batali stepped down amid sexual misconduct allegations , the sexism at play in the industry laid bare ( we all knew it was there , didn ’ t we ? ) . But this feels different. The restaurant world isn ’ t alone in the reckoning. Even the staid James Beard Foundation is considering policy changes for its awards going forward.
Though currently only legal in select states , cannabis-infused beverages will one day be a very lucrative industry — or so giant beverage conglomerate Constellation Brands believes : The company is sinking nearly $ 200 million into developing and marketing cannabis-infused drinks , the Wall Street Journal reports. Constellation , which owns various producers including Robert Mondavi wine and Svedka vodka and also brews Corona for the American market , has acquired a 9.9 percent stake in a Canadian company called Canopy Growth , described as “ the world ’ s largest publicly traded cannabis company. ” Constellation wants to develop non-alcoholic , cannabis-infused beverages , but doesn ’ t plan to sell such products in the U.S. until marijuana is legal nationwide. CEO Rob Sands tells the WSJ that the company believes federal legalization of marijuana is “ highly likely , given what ’ s happened at the state level. ”
Gilmore Girls , the beloved comedy-drama that ended its initial seven-season run in 2007 , is back with a four-part reboot on Netflix. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has always been fond of pop-culture references , and it seems she hasn ’ t missed the celebrity chef movement that exploded in the intervening years between the Gilmore Girls series finale and Gilmore Girls : A Year in the Life. In the new 90-minute episodes , famous culinary pros are name-dropped , and a couple even show up in Stars Hollow ( spoilers ahead ) . In “ Winter , ” the first installment of A Year in the Life , viewers learn the Dragonfly Inn is trying to replace executive chef Sookie St. James , who has abandoned partners Lorelai Gilmore and Michel Gerard for a research mission with Dan Barber at Blue Hill Farm. “ She is helping him develop food-growing techniques and cultivating the evolution of fruits and vegetables , which helps the people who eat them , and — I don ’ t know , they ’ re saving the world , ” Lorelai explains to Michel. “ No , she 's squatting in a cabin with no phone service , trying to grow a pineapple out of a coat rack ! ” Michel rebuffs.
Eater 's deep dive into Korean cuisine has made for all kinds of incredible meals , from fusion to home cooking to the ubiquitous barbecue. Today , Eater LA editor and host Matthew Kang continues the tour in this week 's segment at Kristalbelli , a high-end New York Korean barbecue establishment known for its unique grilling set-up. At Kristalbelli — one of the best places for Korean barbecue in the city — each table is adorned with a clear , crystal grill top , custom made for the restaurant and shipped from Korea. The crystal is able to achieve an incredibly high temperature and ensures an even sear , while also allowing the griller to slice meat directly on its surface without fear of scratches. On top of the crystal ( literally ) , Kristalbelli offers diners dry-aged and Wagyu beef , doubling down on elevating Korean barbecue to fine dining. Watch the video above to learn more.
Doughnuts can do no wrong — or can they ? A Florida man was arrested in Orlando this week for methamphetamine possession after police pulled him over to find several tiny flakes on his car ’ s floorboard. The only problem ? The man isn ’ t addicted to anything other than fresh-from-the-fryer , glazed , Krispy Kreme doughnuts. The Orlando Sentinel reports that cops were convinced the flakes were crystal methamphetamine : “ The officers did two roadside drug tests and both came back positive for the illegal substance , according to his arrest report. ” After failing to come to a full stop while leaving a 7-Eleven , 64-year-old Daniel Rushing was pulled over. That ’ s when the cops spotted the glittery sparkle of addiction — but not the sort of addiction they assumed. " I kept telling them , 'That 's … glaze from a doughnut , ’ ” Rushing told the Sentinel. “ They tried to say it was crack cocaine at first , then they said , 'No , it 's meth , crystal meth. ' "
For decades , Northeast Fremont burger bar Stanich ’ s was a neighborhood favorite , a no-frills sports bar racking up positive local press since opening in 1949. Last year , its cheeseburger was named the best burger in America by Thrillist. Then the restaurant closed , seemingly for good. The publication ’ s burger critic , Kevin Alexander , took responsibility earlier this month , claiming in a widely discussed piece that he “ killed ” the restaurant by giving it national exposure. But a Willamette Week story that dropped today revealed that Stanich ’ s is far from a helpless victim of too much good press : Owner Steve Stanich has a documented history of abusive , manipulative , and petty treatment of both his employees and his family members , including a domestic violence charge for strangling his now-ex-wife and multiple citations for violating probation.
Chick-fil-A has responded to officials at Rider University , who nixed the fast-food chain as a potential on-campus dining options because of its anti-gay history. “ Rider University ’ s survey was recently brought to our attention , and while we respect the University ’ s decision , this news story represents a good opportunity to clarify misperceptions about our brand , ” says a company attorney in a statement provided to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “ Chick-fil-A is a restaurant company focused on food , service and hospitality , and our restaurants and licensed locations on college campuses welcome everyone. We have no policy of discrimination against any group , and we do not have a political or social agenda. More than 120,000 people from different backgrounds and beliefs represent the Chick-fil-A brand. ”
Domestic brand mogul Martha Stewart stepped out this week to haunt your subconscious with a full creepy nurse getup. Stewart , who will soon grace TV screens alongside Snoop Dogg on VH1 , donned the costume on Friday night in preparation for an annual private party hosted by Allison Sarofim and Stuart Parr in New York ’ s West Village. This year ’ s party theme was “ Prince on Prince ” — a nod to the late recording artist Prince and visual artist Richard Prince. The pressed and proper lifestyle queen documented the whole terrifying transformation on her Snapchat and Instagram accounts. The look — complete with bright red contacts , white uniform , and fake blood — was an homage to artist Richard Prince ’ s famous Nurse Paintings series , according to Stewart.

The Meadowbrook Farms Dairy milk truck has arrived , and the insulated box — emblazoned with red script and an image of a Holstein cow — sits on Mahoney 's porch awaiting the milk delivery. Sunbeams reflect off the box and the heavy wire bottle carrier the milk man holds , creating a glare across the porch. The milk man takes the empty glass bottles away and replaces them with full versions , processed and bottled 20 miles away in Clarksville , NY. It ’ s just another day in Modern America. City dwellers choose at-home milk delivery to engage in nostalgic ideals : knowing your farmer and eating from the local foodshed. How we get our food in the U.S. has no doubt changed in time. Once , most of us would have had our own cow ( two , if we were lucky ) to milk for cream , butter , and whey. As food industrialized and people moved away from the rural life , farms grew and specialized in dairy production. Delivering goods direct to consumer was a cost effective and efficient means of milk supply from small , independent dairies. It made sense to have milk delivered straight to the front door in a time when bread , meat , and produce were all purchased from individual shops and retailers.
